Harald Schultz-Hencke melded psychology with the Nazi theory of biology and racial origins, criticizing psychoanalysis as a study of the weak and deformed. Johannes Heinrich Schultz, a German psychologist recognized for developing the technique of autogenic training, prominently advocated sterilization and euthanasia of men considered genetically undesirable, and devised techniques for facilitating this process.\nAfter the war, new institutions were created although some psychologists, because of their Nazi affiliation, were discredited. Alexander Mitscherlich founded a prominent applied psychoanalysis journal called Psyche. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Mitscherlich established the first clinical psychosomatic medicine division at Heidelberg University. In 1970, psychology was integrated into the required studies of medical students.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks promoted psychology as a way to engineer the \"New Man\" of socialism. Consequently, university psychology departments trained large numbers of students in psychology. At the completion of training, positions were made available for those students at schools, workplaces, cultural institutions, and in the military. The Russian state emphasized pedology and the study of child development. Lev Vygotsky became prominent in the field of child development. The Bolsheviks also promoted free love and embraced the doctrine of psychoanalysis as an antidote to sexual repression.:\u200a84\u20136\u200a Although pedology and intelligence testing fell out of favor in 1936, psychology maintained its privileged position as an instrument of the Soviet Union.

Luria, Aron Zalkind, and even Ivan Pavlov (posthumously) were denounced.\n   - Discuss how this denunciation was part of a larger anti-Semitic campaign in the Soviet Union.\n\n5. **Comparison with Germany:**\n   - Briefly compare and contrast the influence of politics on psychology in Germany and Russia during the early 20th century.\n   - Highlight similarities (e.g., both regimes used psychology for ideological purposes) and differences (e.g., Nazi eugenics vs. Soviet \"New Man\" project).",

                "query": " thinking, and emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from subjective self-reports, which may be problematic. Experimental psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure these elusive phenomenological entities.\nDivisions still exist within the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as data points within a larger population. Critics inside and outside the field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly dominated by a \"cult of empiricism\", which limits the scope of research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived from the physical sciences.:\u200a36\u20137\u200a Feminist critiques have argued that claims to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of (historically) mostly male researchers. Jean Grimshaw, for example, argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior.:\u200a120\u200a\n\n\n== Major schools of thought ==\n\n\n=== Biological ===\n\nPsychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study. Behaviorial neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals. The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals. A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain. From Phineas Gage to H.M. and Clive Wearing, individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area. Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating he"

        "topics": "Based on the provided context and the student's question, here are the key topics a teacher should elaborate on to comprehensively address the measurement challenges in psychology and ensure validity when using indirect methods:\n\n1. **Validity Types**: Explain the different types of validity relevant to psychological research, such as:\n   - **Face Validity**: Does the measure appear \"on its face\" to measure what it claims to?\n   - **Content Validity**: Is the measure comprehensive in covering the construct it aims to assess?\n   - **Criterion Validity**: Does the measure predict future behavior or correlate with other measures of the same construct (concurrent validity)?\n   - **Construct Validity**: Does the measure relate to other variables as expected based on theory?\n\n2. **Triangulation and Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix (MTMM)**: Discuss how using multiple methods, measures, or sources can enhance validity. This approach, known as triangulation, helps to cross-validate findings and reduce measurement error. The MTMM matrix is a statistical tool used to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of multiple measures.\n\n3. **Cognitive Debriefing**: Explain this technique where participants are interviewed after completing a measure to understand their thought processes and ensure that the intended construct was indeed measured. This helps identify any biases or misunderstandings in the measurement process.\n\n4. **Experimental Designs for Indirect Measures**: Describe how experimental psychologists use specific designs, such as:\n   - **Manipulation Checks**: To verify that an independent variable has been successfully manipulated.\n   - **Placebo Controls**: To rule out non-specific effects (e.g., expectation, demand characteristics) in studies using indirect measures like drugs or sham treatments.\n\n5. **Addressing Biases and Limitations**: Discuss how psychologists address potential biases and limitations inherent in indirect measurement methods, such as:\n   - **Social Desirability Bias**: Participants' tendency to present themselves in a favorable light.\n   - **Demand Characteristics**: Participants' tendency to respond in ways they believe the experimenter wants.\n   - **Method Variance**: Systematic error introduced by the method of data collection (e.g., self-report, observation).",
