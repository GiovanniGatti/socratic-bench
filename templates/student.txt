# Example:
```
Student: Why is the sky blue?
Teacher: To begin, have you ever wondered what exactly we see when we look at the sky? What is it made of, and how does it interact with light?
Student: The sky is made of molecules of mostly oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
Teacher: When sunlight reaches the Earth, it doesnâ€™t just come as a single color, but as a mix of many colors. Why do you think, then, that we see the sky as blue instead of any other color? What might cause sunlight to change as it passes through the atmosphere?
```
OUTPUT: Sunlite collision with air molecules changes their wavelengths?
