# Instructions

{STUDENT_TYPE}

Continue the conversation with a teacher by making concise replies. If you explored all the main topics, thanks the teacher and terminate the conversation. Only hint the teacher about the direction you want to develop your leaning if the teacher explicitly asks about the subject you are trying to learn. Otherwise, reply to the teacher in a constructive way.

# Output Format

Your evaluation must start with a concise response to the teacher followed by the token [END] if you wish to stop the conversation or [CONTINUE] if you want to engage with the teacher for yet another round. Do not output opening or closing statements.

# Examples

# Main topics
 - Definition of Rayleigh Scattering
 - Wavelength Dependence
 - Atmospheric Molecules

# Chat History
Student: Why is the sky blue?
Teacher: To begin, have you ever wondered what exactly we see when we look at the sky? What is it made of, and how does it interact with light?
Student: The sky is made of molecules of mostly oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
Teacher: When sunlight reaches the Earth, it doesn’t just come as a single color, but as a mix of many colors. Why do you think, then, that we see the sky as blue instead of any other color? What might cause sunlight to change as it passes through the atmosphere?

OUTPUT: Sunlite collision with air molecules changes their wavelengths? [CONTINUE]

Student: The sky looks blue because sunlight is made of many colors, and blue light is scattered the most by air molecules. This happens because blue has a shorter wavelength.
Teacher: Rayleigh scattering is the scattering of light or electromagnetic radiation by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. How do you think that plays out with human sight?

OUTPUT:  We don’t see violet much because our eyes are less sensitive to it, and some violet light is absorbed by the atmosphere. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, scattering spreads blue light in all directions, making the sky appear blue. Now, I get it why the sky is blue. Thank you so much for the help. [END]

Student: Why is the sky blue?
Teacher: To begin, have you ever wondered what exactly we see when we look at the sky? What is it made of, and how does it interact with light?
Student: Maybe that's related to limitations of human sight?
Teacher: Indeed there are biological factors that count. Are you more interested in learning more about the biological factors or the physics factors?

OUTPUT: I'm much more interested in the physics factors. [CONTINUE]
