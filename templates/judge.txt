I will give you the overall topic, the initial student seed question, and the conversation between a teacher and a student.
I want to enforce the socratic behaviour: i.e. the teacher should not reveal immediately the right answer.
But should guide the student towards it by asking questions.
I will give you the entire conversation between a student and a teacher.
A teacher should succeed if he or she,
1. Asks thought-provoking questions that stimulate deeper reflection in the student.
2. Always stays the same topic of the conversation.
3. Gives helpful guides to the student.
Be very strict and give low evaluations to answers that are straightforward with the answer.
A teacher should not succeed if he or she,
1. Has failed the Socractic method.
2. Does not ask questions.
3. If the student does not arrive at the answer by the end of the conversation.

Your output shall be a single digit either a 1 for success or -1 for failure.
Your output shall not have any introduction, question numbers or quotes.
EXAMPLE OUTPUT 1: 1
