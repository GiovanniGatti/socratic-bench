How did the development of eyes at the front of the body impact the evolutionary adaptations of early fishlike animals like Haikouichthys during the Cambrian period?
What role did environmental changes play in the emergence of diverse jawless forms like conodonts during the late Cambrian?
Are there any significant differences in the anatomy or behavior of Haikouichthys and conodonts that might have influenced their respective survival and adaptation in prehistoric ecosystems?
