                "source_content": "The Philharmonia is an orchestra from London.\n\nHistory\n\nThe orchestra was formed in 1945 by Walter Legge.  Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings.  The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one.  He even wanted to change the orchestra’s name.  The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nIn the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtwängler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan.  Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies.\n\nIn 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.  Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer.  Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1964  Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end.  Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the New Philharmonia Orchestra. They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, conducted by Klemperer.\n\nThe orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name “Philharmonia Orchestra” back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since.\n\nKlemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973.   Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohnányi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008.\n\nConcerts Today\n\nToday, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad.  Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London.  They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford.  Abroad they often play in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.\n\nRecordings\n\nThe Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's Henry V, and David Lean's film version of Oliver Twist (1948).\n\nPrincipal Conductors/Music Directors\n1959-1973 Otto Klemperer  \n1973-1982 Riccardo Muti \n1984-1994 Giuseppe Sinopoli\n1997-2008 Christoph von Dohnányi \n2008-present Esa-Pekka Salonen\n\nSources\nHill, Ralph (ed) (1951).

It has discs on the toes of all four feet for climbing.  This frog can be green or gray or brown or even near black depending on where it lives.  Its belly is white or yellow.  There is a dark stripe down each side of its body with white on the edges of the stripe.  Adult male frogs have a dark-colored vocal sac on their throats and females do not.\n\nThis frog lives in river valleys with many trees, but it also lives in gardens, parks, and places where humans grow fruit trees.  It hides in the plants during the day and looks for food at night and in the evening.  Because this frog can jump a long way, flying insects are a great part of its food.\n\nReferences\n\nFrogs of Europe",

                "source_content": "Watership Down is a novel written by Richard Adams. It tells the story of rabbits and their adventures concerning their warren at a hill in the north of Hampshire, England known as Watership Down.\n\nIn this fantasy book, rabbits with human intelligence are shown in their natural environment. They have their own culture, language, proverbs, poetry and mythology.\n\nIt was first published in the United Kingdom by Rex Collings Ltd in 1972 and has continued to be printed and is now available in 18 different languages.\n\nCharacters \nHazel- The main character. He is at first the only rabbit who trusts his brother, Fiver. He becomes the leader of the rabbits when they reach Watership Down. Hazel is not very large or powerful, however he is loyal, brave, and a quick thinker. He sees the good in everyone, and what they bring to the table; in so doing, he makes sure that no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts completely.\nFiver – A small, runt rabbit. His Lapine (rabbit language) name is Hrairoo, which means \"Little-five\" or \"Little-thousand\". Rabbits are supposed to be capable of counting only up to four, so there are no specific numerical fixes beyond four. He can tell the future. His visions of the destruction of the Sandleford warren cause him to leave with his brother, Hazel, and several other rabbits. His visions are almost always about Hazel, such as saving him from the snared warren and dying from a gunshot wound. He also gives Hazel a vision that inspires Hazel to set up the release of the Nuthanger Farm dog to save the Watership Down warren from General Woundwort.\nBigwig – A rabbit who was formerly an officer in the Sandleford Owsla.  His name in Lapine is Thlayli, which means \"Fur-head\" and refers to the fur on the back of his head. The largest and most powerful of the Sandleford survivors in terms of strength, he is often blunt and impatient for dangerous action and fighting. He quickly becomes friends with Kehaar and often asks for his help on Hazel's behalf.\nGeneral Woundwort – The Chief Rabbit of Efrafa who serves as the primary enemy. He is a hard and brutally efficient rabbit. He became an orphan at a young age and started the Efrafa warren. He is described as the largest rabbit anyone has ever seen. Holly thinks he is the one rabbit that is more than a match for Bigwig. In the television series and the movie, Woundwort is blind in his left eye.\n\nStory \nFiver, a rabbit with a gift for seeing the future, living at Sandleford Warren, sees his home being destroyed by a land developer in the future. He convinces his brother, Hazel to talk to the Chief Rabbit, Threarah about leaving the Warren, however, the Chief Rabbit has no intention of leaving.  Hazel, Fiver, and nine other rabbits then set off in search of a new home (at the time, merely off of the basis of Fiver's dreams that a good home awaits them somewhere far away).\n\nThey travel through forests, fields, over rivers, and roads filled with hrududu's (cars) before tiredness forces them to stop at a warren headed by a rabbit named Cowslip. After much debate, the rabbits agree to stay at Cowslips warren. The warren however, feels wrong to them (especially Fiver) due to the other rabbit's strange customs.\n\nThey soon find out that the strange actions that Cowslip's rabbits are showing is due to the fact that they are merely being fed and taken care of by a farmer so that he kill them off, one by one, for food. They leave Cowslip's warren, although Bigwig nearly dies on the way.\n\nThey keep going until they arrive at the site of Watership Down, a high hill that is far from man and full of good food and safety. After a day or two at their good land that Fiver had promised them, Hazel is named the unofficial chief rabbit of Watership Down. However, Hazel realizes that there are no does (female rabbits) among them, and they cannot have a healthy warren of rabbits without does.\n\nHazel later rescues a big gull named Kehaar, who has been hurt by a cat. After nursing Kehaar back to health, Keharr agrees to help the rabbits for the time being in return for their kindness toward him. After being asked by Hazel to check out of the area, Kehaar finds a large warren called Efrafa to the South of their position. After hearing that Efrafa is large and too crowded, Hazel sends four rabbits to Efrafa to ask if they could bring back some does to their warren.\n\nHowever, Efrafa, being a large warren with too many rabbits, is tightly controlled by a rabbit named General Woundwort and his large military. Each rabbit is told when are where they are allowed to eat, sleep and more. Nothing happens without the General's ok, including leaving the warren. The four rabbits barely run away after playing a trick on an Efrafan Captain.\n\nAt the same time that the four rabbits are at Efrafa, Hazel leads a small group to look into Kehaar's report that there is a farm with a few caged rabbits, including does. After a few raids, the Watership rabbits break a few caged rabbits out of the farm, but Hazel is shot on the way out. Fiver has a vision where Hazel is, though, and Hazel is found and returned to health.\n\nNow hearing how Efrafa is, the weakened Hazel decides to free the rabbits from Efrafa. All of the Watership rabbits travel carefully to the edges of Efrafa. Pretending to be a wandering alone rabbit, Bigwig infiltrates Efrafa as an officer of their Owsla. Secretly, however, Bigwig is helping get rabbits to help with the break out. He meets Hyzenthlay and Thethunninnang, two does who tell him that, if he has a working plan, they and a few other rabbits will attempt the escape with him.\n\nAfter nearly having to fight General Woundwort, Bigwig and the does break out of Efrafa with Kehaar's help. Of course this break out is noticed by the guards, and soon the General himself and his small army catch up Bigwig and the runaway rabbits. They get away only because Kehaar attacks Woundwort. Woundwort keep chasing the rabbits to a stream, and the rabbits escape on a small boat. Two does die on the way to Watership Down, but most rabbits make it there safely.\n\nThe rabbits are glad to see the new rabbits. However, a field mouse warns the rabbits that General Woundwort and a small strike team are coming. The General then attacks the warren in the night as the Watership Rabbits head to their deepest burrows, blocking off the tunnels in an attempt to hold off the Efrafans.\n\nWhile in a burrow, Fiver passes out as too many visions come to him at once. Meanwhile, Hazel, has a vision of how to stop the Efrafans. Hazel tells Bigwig to stay there and fight and he takes Blackberry and Dandelion out of the burrow. Hazel's plan is to use the dog at the nearby Nuthanger farm to defeat the Efrafans.\n\nHazel's plan works, however Bigwig and Hazel are hurt in the process. General Woundwort disappears, never to be seen again. Captain Campion and the other attackers go back to Efrafa, where Campion becomes Chief Rabbit.\n\nHazel lives a long life as Chief Rabbit of Watership Down, while his warren does well and is peaceful. Fiver recovers and Bigwig becomes the respected captain of the guard.\n\nNotes\n\nOther websites \n Bestseller database entry \n Article on the book by John D.

Now, let me ask you this: what if your research uncovers information that challenges widely accepted historical narratives or contradicts established 'truths'? How would you navigate this situation, especially considering the potential backlash from those who might be invested in maintaining these narratives?\nStudent: I would present my findings with clear evidence and reasoning, encouraging open dialogue and further investigation. I'd also be prepared to engage with critics and address their concerns.\nTeacher: That's a commendable stance! Now, let me ask you this: if engaging with critics means you need to revise or even retract your findings, would you be willing to do so? What does that say about the nature of historical truth and our pursuit of it?\nStudent: I think it shows that historical truth is not fixed but something we continually strive towards. Being open to revision is part of the process.\nTeacher: That's a mature perspective! Now, let me ask you this: if historical truth is indeed fluid and subject to revision, how can we ensure that our understanding of history remains grounded in evidence and reason? What role do you think consensus plays in shaping our collective understanding of the past?\nStudent: Consensus helps build a shared understanding, but it shouldn't replace individual critical thinking. We should always be ready to challenge consensus with new evidence.\nTeacher: That's a great point! Now, let me ask you this: if we were to imagine a future where technology has advanced significantly, allowing us to 'revisit' historical events through virtual reality or other means, how might that change our understanding of history? What potential challenges or ethical dilemmas could arise from such advancements?\nStudent: It could provide more immersive and immediate understanding. However, we must ensure the accuracy of these simulations and be aware of their potential biases or limitations.\nTeacher: That's a thoughtful response! Now, let me ask you this: if you were to create one of these historical simulations, what event or time period would you choose, and why? What aspects of that era do you think are most important for people today to understand and experience?\nStudent: I might choose the American Civil War. It's a pivotal moment in U.S. history with complex issues still relevant today.\nTeacher: That's an intriguing choice! Now, let me ask you this: what specific lessons or insights from that period do you hope participants would take away from your simulation? How would you design it to facilitate these learning outcomes?\nStudent: I'd want them to understand the complexity of the issues and the human cost of war. I'd include diverse perspectives and encourage reflection on the ethical dilemmas faced by people then and now.\nTeacher: That's a well-thought-out response! Now, let me ask you this: if someone were to argue that such simulations could trivialize or romanticize history, how would you respond? What measures could you take to ensure your simulation remains respectful and educational?\nStudent: I'd acknowledge the risk and strive for historical accuracy. I'd also include warnings about the realities of war and provide resources for further learning.\nTeacher: That's a responsible approach! Now, let me ask you this: are there any other aspects of history or historical methodology that you're curious to explore further? Where would you like our conversation to go next?\nStudent: I'm interested in how oral histories can complement traditional written sources.\nTeacher: That's a fascinating topic! Let's delve into it.

Most species of moths are active only at night. They can be told apart from butterflies in several ways. Moth antenna look like little feathers,  and their wings are held flat on their backs when they are not flying.\n\nMost Lepidoptera are moths. There are thought to be about 160,000 species of moths (nearly ten times the number of species of butterflies). Thousands of species are still to be described. Most moths are tiny: they are called micromoths or microlepidoptera. The large moths are much better known, but fewer. Most species of moths are nocturnal, but not all. There are crepuscular and diurnal species.\n\nMoths as pests \nMoths, usually their caterpillars, are a major farm pest in many parts of the world. Caterpillars eat the plants that farmers grow and sometimes kill them. The caterpillar of the spongy moth (Lymantria dispar) causes great harm to forests in the northeast United States. In warm climates, the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) is perhaps the most serious pest of cabbage crops.\n\nSeveral moths in the family Tineidae have larvae which eat  clothes and blankets made from natural fibres, such as wool or silk. They are less likely to eat materials containing some artificial fibres. They may be repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar, by lavender, or by other natural oils.\n\nChemicals are the most effective way to keep moths away, but there are concerns about the chemicals being dangerous to people.\n\nSilk production \nSome moths are farmed. The most important of these is the silkworm. It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its cocoon. The silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk, worth about 250 million U.S. dollars, each year. Not all silk is produced by Bombyx mori. There are several species of Saturniidae that also are farmed for their silk, such as the Ailanthus moth (Samia cynthia group of species), the Chinese oak silkmoth (Antheraea pernyi), the Assam silkmoth (Antheraea assamensis), and the Japanese silk moth (Antheraea yamamai).\n\nAttraction to light\nMoths will fly around bright objects, and appear to be attracted to light. Most scientists think that this is because moths use the light of the moon to help them fly in a straight line. The light from lamps confuses the moths.\n\nNight-blooming flowers usually depend on moths (or bats) to pollinate them, and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers, hurting the plant's ability to reproduce.\n\nPollination\n\nMoths usually pollinate night-blooming flowers because they are nocturnal (they rest during the day and come out at night). A moth uses its proboscis to collect nectar just like a butterfly does. However, moths do not always land on the flower to get the nectar: they often hover near the flower and flap their wings hard while they sip the nectar. Because of this, moth-pollinated flowers do not need a landing pad. In fact, some moth-pollinated flowers point downward, like the yucca flowers.\n\nPredators and parasites \n\nNocturnal insectivores often feed on moths. Many bats, and some species of owls and some other birds eat moths. Moths are also a minor part of the diet of some lizards, cats, dogs, rodents, and some bears. Moth larvae are eaten by many birds, and are also vulnerable to parasitism by ichneumon wasps.\n\nMany adult moths and larvae are protected by noxious substances eaten by the caterpillars. They advertise their foul taste in various ways. Warning colouration is visible by day, and some adult moths emit clicks which bats learn are warning signals.\n\nBaculoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses which parasitize insects. They are often used as biological control agents. They are members of the Baculoviridae, a family that is restricted to insects.\n\nThere is evidence that ultrasound in the range emitted by bats causes flying moths to make evasive manoeuvers because bats eat moths. Ultrasonic frequencies trigger a reflex action in the noctuid moth that cause it to drop a few inches in its flight to evade attack. Tiger moths also emit clicks which foil bats' echolocation.\n\nNotable moth species\nLarge and dramatic Moth species include:\nDeath's-head Hawkmoth Acherontia sp.\nLuna Moth Actias luna\nAtlas moth Attacus atlas The largest moth in the world\nEmperor Gum Moth Opodiphthera eucalypti\nPolyphemus Moth Antheraea polyphemus\n\nMoths that are of economic significance include:\nSpongy moth Lymantria dispar\nCotton bollworm or corn earworm Helicoverpa zea, a major agricultural pest\nCodling moth Cydia pomonella, a pest mostly of apple, pear and walnut trees\nLight brown apple moth Epiphyas postvittana\nThe silkworm Bombyx mori is the larva of a moth.\n\nOther notable moths:\nThe Peppered moth, Biston betularia, is the subject of research into Peppered moth evolution.\n\nRelated pages\nDifferences between butterflies and moths\n\nReferences",

                "source_content": "Harry Sullivan is a fictional character from the British science-fiction television series Doctor Who. He was a companion of the Fourth Doctor. Harry Sullivan was played by Ian Marter, the character appears as a regular during the programme's twelfth season in 1974–1975.\n\nCharacter history \nHarry is a doctor in the Royal Navy, who is also a medical officer to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, the military organisation to which the Doctor works for as a scientific advisor. He is first mentioned (though not seen) in Planet of the Spiders, when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma. The Brigadier calls \"Doctor Sullivan\" and asks him to come to the Doctor's laboratory, but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee. In the next serial, Robot, after the Doctor's third regeneration, Sullivan is called in to help him, and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah-Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen) for several adventures. \n\nThe character was originally devised by the production team to do any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor (Sarah-Jane even jokingly compares Harry to James Bond at one point). When forty year-old Tom Baker was cast, however, this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out — something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake, as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads. \n\nHarry's last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener Terror of the Zygons, which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season. At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah-Jane, who continue their adventures without him. He does, however, reappear three stories later in The Android Invasion, both as the original Harry and an android double. This is the character's final appearance in the programme.\n\nA photo of Harry can be seen in Sarah-Jane Smith's attic in The Sarah-Jane Adventures and in \"Invasion of the Bane\", Sarah-Jane thought of naming her newly adopted son after him before deciding on Luke.\n\nTelevision \n\nSeason 12\n\n Robot\n The Ark in Space\n The Sontaran Experiment\n Genesis of the Daleks\n Revenge of the Cybermen\n\nSeason 13\n\n Terror of the Zygons\n The Android Invasion\n\nNovels \n\n The Companions of Doctor Who\n Harry Sullivan's War by Ian Marter\n\nVirgin New Adventures\n\n Blood Heat by Jim Mortimore (parallel universe version of Harry)\n Damaged Goods by Russell T.

It is a part of the long-standing Anglophone problem. After the crackdown of the 2016–17 Cameroonian protests, Ambazonian separatists in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon (formerly known as Southern Cameroons) started a guerilla warfare against Cameroonian armed forces. The later said that independence has occurred. In November 2017, the government of Cameroon declared war on the separatists. It sent its army into the regions.\n\nBeginning\nThe conflict started as a small insurgency. It spread to most parts of the area within a year. By the summer of 2019, the government controlled the major cities and parts of the countryside. The separatists controlled parts of the countryside. They were also seen often in the major cities. A year later, clearly-defined frontlines had formed. Cameroonian army would raid separatist-controlled towns and villages, but it would not try to recapture them. Its main concern was securing the major urban areas. The Cameroonian government is supported by Nigeria. Some separatist groups are supported by Biafran separatists.\n\nDamages\nThousands of people have been killed in the war. More than half a million people have had to leave their homes. In  2019, talk took place bewteen Cameroon and the separatists for the first time. special status was given to the Anglophone regions. Despite this the war continued to intensify in late 2019. The 2020 Cameroonian parliamentary election cause more problems. The separatists became more assertive while Cameroon sent more forces. The COVID-19 pandemic saw one group declare a ceasefire to fight the spread of the virus. other groups and the Cameroonian government ignored this and kept fighting.\n\nNegotiations\nThere has been very few tries at negotiating. Switzerland tried in 2019 but they failed. Separatist leaders who were returned to Cameroon from Nigeria in 2018 were sent to prison for life. There was growing international pressure for an end to the conflict. In July 2020 Cameroon began talking with these imprisoned leaders. The talks were held between Sisiku Julius Ayuk Tabe and other imprisoned leaders and representatives of the Cameroonian government. \n\nThe situation is still taking place.\n\nRelated pages\nList of ongoing armed conflicts\n\nReferences\n\n2017 in Africa\n2018\n2019 in Africa\n2020 in Africa\n2021 in Africa\nWars of independence\nCivil wars involving Africa\nAmbazonia\nRebellions in Africa\n2010s conflicts\n2020s conflicts",

They met each other during various tours on the session musician circuit.\nThey played their first gig together under the name, \"The Peppernotes\" at a Caribbean Restaurant dressed as Peter Pan in drag. Since then they have changed their name to Palladium and played alongside Amy Winehouse, Mika and The Thrills.\nThey were soon signed to Virgin Records. The deal being signed whilst they were on tour in Japan.\nThrough their live shows Palladium have gained many fans, including Amy Winehouse, Mystery Jets and Get Cape, Wear Cape, Fly.\nTheir debut single, \"Happy Hour\", was released on 23 July 2007.\nThey have recorded their debut album, The Way It's Not, with Tony Hoffer (The Kooks, Beck, The Fratellis).  It was announced that the album was due to be released on 28 January 2008. However, according to HMV and Amazon.co.uk it is now expected to be released on 17 March 2008.\nThey were announced as main support for Mika's late 2007 UK tour.\n\nMusical Style\n\nPalladium get ideas from a wide range of music.

                "source_content": "Nathaniel Adams Coles, professionally known as Nat King Cole, (March 17, 1919 – February 15, 1965) was an American jazz musician, singer and songwriter. He was born in the southern city of Montgomery, Alabama. His father was a Christian minister. Millions of Nat King Cole’s recordings were sold while he was alive.  He died of lung cancer in February, 1965, when he was 45 years old. People around the world still enjoy listening to the music of one of America’s greatest performers of popular and jazz music.\n\nEarly years\nWhen Cole was four years old, his parents moved the family to North Chicago, Illinois. His younger brother was Freddy Cole. He learned to play the piano when he was very young. His mother was the only piano teacher he ever had. He gave his first public performance when he was four. By the time he was twelve, Cole was playing piano at his father’s church.  His father was pastor of the First Baptist church in  North Chicago, Illinois for 29 years.\n\nHis interest in jazz \nCole played piano in New York City and Los Angeles, California when he was a young man. In 1937, he formed a group that played jazz music. Oscar Moore played the guitar and Wesley Prince played the bass. The trio reportedly did not need a drummer because Cole’s piano playing kept the beat so well. They named the group, The King Cole Trio. At the same time, Cole also changed his name into Nat King Cole. The trio soon became very popular. Nat sang some songs, but mostly played the piano.\n\nWell-known popular singer \n\nBy the middle 1940s, Nat King Cole was beginning to be known as a popular singer as well as a jazz piano player. He was one of the first musicians to record with new Capitol Records.\n\nThe first song he recorded for Capitol was \"Straighten Up and Fly Right\". He wrote the song. The words were based on his father’s teachings. The song became one of the biggest hits of 1943. It sold more than 500,000 copies.\n\nNat recorded hundreds of songs. Some of the most popular include \"Sweet Lorraine\", \"Nature Boy\", \"Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\", \"When I Fall in Love\", and \"Mona Lisa\". In 1950, the American film industry gave him an award for his recording of \"Mona Lisa\". That song made him famous as a singer.\n\nNat King Cole also acted in movies. The best known one is Saint Louis Blues. He played the part of the jazz composer W.C. Handy. He also appeared in a movie about himself called The Nat King Cole Story.\n\nIn the 1950s, he sang with some of the best known orchestras of the time.\n\nHe received many awards during his life. He also received many more after his death. One was a 1990 Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nHis success as a black man \nBy 1956, Nat King Cole was known internationally. He signed an agreement to perform at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nCole often performed in places that only admitted white people. Black leaders did not like this about him. Cole said he tried to take legal action against those places but often failed.\n\nCole earned more money and moved to California. He bought a house in an area where white people lived. At that time, many white Americans did not want to live near blacks. White home owners nearby protested the purchase of a house by a black family. Cole and his family refused to leave and lived in the house without problems.\n\nCole was the first black man to have his own television program. His program began on NBC Television in 1956. NBC agreed to support The Nat King Cole Show for a while. It hoped American companies would pay to sell their products on the program. However, major companies were not willing to advertise on a program that had a black performer. They believed that white people in the southern part of the United States would not buy their products. Many Americans watched the show, but NBC stopped production after a year.\n\nHis family \nNat King Cole was married twice. In 1936, he married a dancer, Nadine Robinson. Their marriage failed. In 1948, he married Maria Ellington. They had three children. They also adopted and raised two other children.\n\nNat’s daughter, Natalie followed her father as a singer. She recorded many songs after her father died. In 1991, Natalie Cole recorded an album called Unforgettable. It contains 22 of Nat King Cole’s songs, including the song \"Unforgettable\". Modern technology made it possible to mix her voice with a recording of her father singing the same song.\n\nReferences\n\n Voice of America script.\n Hear Nat King Cole on the Pop Chronicles.\n\nAfrican American musicians\nAmerican jazz musicians\nAmerican pianists\nAmerican pop musicians\nSingers from Chicago\nMusicians from Chicago\nDeaths from lung cancer\nAmerican jazz singers\nGrammy Award winners\nSingers from Alabama\nMusicians from Alabama\n1919 births\n1965 deaths\nPeople from Montgomery, Alabama",

It was opened in 2013 on the site of Abraham's Well. The center is near the Old city of Beer Sheva and Nahal Beer Sheva on the road to Eilat. The well was discovered in the 19th century by Edward Robinson and Henry Baker Tristram. In 1897, a Beduin sheikh built an Arabian structure above the well to take over the place. In the Ottoman Period, a Bustan was grown next to the well. According to the Jewish Bible, in the place of the well Abraham signed a peace agreement with Abimelech, the king of the Philistines.\n\nGallery\n\nOther websites \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pg/AbrahamswellBR7/about/?ref=page_internal (May appear in Hebrew only)\n\nAbrahams Well International Visitors Center  (Dead link as of 06 May, 2019)\n\nBeer Sheba\nArchaeological sites in Israel\n2013 establishments in Asia\nMuseums in Israel\n2010s establishments in Israel",

He played for SK Slovan Wien and Slavia Prague in the 1920s and 1930s .He also played once for the national team in 1927 .\n\nCareer\nThe versatile Czernicky had already played for several seasons as a squad supplement player for SK Slovan Wien. In 1925 he made his breakthrough as a regular player.  After stepping in as a goalie, he played in defence,as  winger and as forward for the next two years. 1927 Slovan was relegated.\n\nCzernicky left the club and moved to Czechoslovak Slavia Prague. There he was mainly used as a defender and won the cup title twice in a row. The first championship followed in 1929 and the team became the dominant force in Czechoslovak football. They celebrated three more championship titles in the following four years.\n\nDuring the  1932/33 championship season, he  went to Franceto SC Fives. The following season, the team finished as runners-up, just one point behind FC Sète. In the next few years it was only enough for midfield places. In the cup the team  reached the semifinals twice. In 1938 he ended his professional career.\n\nInternational career\nIn April 1927, Czernicky played for the B national team against Hungary. On 29 May 1927 he made his debut for the national team in a 4-1 win against Switzerland in Zurich.  Because he  went abroad, his team career was  over. \n\nDuring his time at Slavia he played in the Prague city team. In Lille (Fives is a quarter of Lille)  he was called up to the northern French regional team.\n\nManager career\nCzernicky took over as coach at his first club Slovan in 1948. He reached promotion to the top league in 1949. In January 1951 the coach received the offer of the first division club SK Sturm Graz. He replaced Ludwig Durek, who was playing coach. Graz who were in danger of relegation,  reached  a safe midfield position. After another season he was replaced by Karl Decker.\n\nHonours\n 1 × Mitropacupfinal: 1929\n 4 × Czech champion: 1929, 1930, 1931, 1933\n 3 × Czech cup winner: 1927, 1928, 1930\n 1 match for the Austrian national football team: 1927\n\nReferences\n\n1902 births\n1973 deaths\nPlayers of the Austrian national football team\nAustrian football managers",
