                "source_content": "Another important voltammetric technique is stripping voltammetry, which consists of three related techniques: anodic stripping voltammetry, cathodic stripping voltammetry, and adsorptive stripping voltammetry. Because anodic stripping voltammetry is the more widely used of these techniques, we will consider it in greatest detail.\n\nAnodic stripping voltammetry consists of two steps (Figure $1$). The first step is a controlled potential electrolysis in which we hold the working electrode—usually a hanging mercury drop or a mercury film electrode—at a cathodic potential sufficient to deposit the metal ion on the electrode. For example, when analyzing Cu2+ the deposition reaction is\n\n$\\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Cu}(\\mathrm{Hg}) \\label{sv1}$\n\nwhere Cu(Hg) indicates that the copper is amalgamated with the mercury. This step serves as a means of concentrating the analyte by transferring it from the larger volume of the solution to the smaller volume of the electrode. During most of the electrolysis we stir the solution to increase the rate of deposition. Near the end of the deposition time we stop the stirring—eliminating convection as a mode of mass transport—and allow the solution to become quiescent. Typical deposition times of 1–30 min are common, with analytes at lower concentrations requiring longer times.\n\nIn the second step, we scan the potential anodically—that is, toward a more positive potential. When the working electrode’s potential is sufficiently positive, the analyte is stripped from the electrode, returning to solution in its oxidized form.\n\n$\\mathrm{Cu}(\\mathrm{Hg})\\rightleftharpoons \\text{ Cu}^{2+}+2 e^{-} \\label{sv2}$\n\nMonitoring the current during the stripping step gives a peak-shaped voltammogram, as shown in Figure $1$. The peak current is proportional to the analyte’s concentration in the solution. Because we are concentrating the analyte in the electrode, detection limits are much smaller than other electrochemical techniques. An improvement of three orders of magnitude—the equivalent of parts per billion instead of parts per million—is routine.\n\nApplications\n\nAnodic stripping voltammetry is very sensitive to experimental conditions, which we must carefully control to obtain results that are accurate and precise. Key variables include the area of the mercury film or the size of the hanging Hg drop, the deposition time, the rest time, the rate of stirring, and the scan rate during the stripping step. Anodic stripping voltammetry is particularly useful for metals that form amalgams with mercury, several examples of which are listed in Table $1$.\n\nTable $1$.

Fourier analysis of periodic waveforms in terms of harmonic trigonometric functions plays a key role in describing oscillatory motion in classical mechanics and signal processing for linear systems. Fourier’s theorem states that any arbitrary forcing function $F(t)$ can be decomposed into a sum of harmonic terms. As a consequence two equivalent representations can be used to describe signals and waves; the first is in the time domain which describes the time dependence of the signal. The second is in the frequency domain which describes the frequency decomposition of the signal. Fourier analysis relates these equivalent representations.\n\nFor example, the superposition of two equal intensity harmonic oscillators in the time domain is given by\n\n$\\label{eq:3.103} y(t) = A\\cos(\\omega_1t) + A\\cos(\\omega_2t) \\ = 2A\\cos \\Bigg [ \\Bigg ( \\frac{\\omega_1 + \\omega_2}{2} \\Bigg ) t \\Bigg] \\cos \\Bigg [ \\Bigg (\\frac{\\omega_1 - \\omega_2}{2} \\Bigg ) t \\Bigg ]$\n\nThe free linearly-damped linear oscillator\n\nThe response of the free, linearly-damped, linear oscillator is one of the most frequently encountered waveforms in science and thus it is useful to investigate the Fourier transform of this waveform. The damped waveform for the underdamped case, shown in figure (3.5.1) is given by equation (3.5.12), that is\n\n\\begin{align} \\label{eq:3.104} f(t) & = & Ae^{-\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}t}\\cos(\\omega_1t-\\delta) && t \\geq 0 \\ \\label{eq:3.105} f(t) & = & 0 && t < 0 \\end{align}\n\nwhere $\\omega_1^2 = \\omega_0^2 - \\big ( \\frac{\\Gamma}{2} \\big )^2$ and where $\\omega_0$ is the angular frequency of the underdamped system. The Fourier transform is given by\n\n$\\label{eq:3.106} G(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega_0}{(\\omega^2 - \\omega_1^2)^2 + (\\Gamma \\omega)^2} [ (\\omega^2 - \\omega_1^2) - i \\Gamma \\omega ]$\n\nwhich is complex and has the famous Lorentz form.\n\nThe intensity of the wave gives\n\n$|f(t)|^2 = A^2 e^{-\\Gamma t} \\cos^2 (\\omega_1 t - \\delta) \\label{3.107}$\n\n$|G ( \\omega)|^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2_0}{(\\omega^2 - \\omega^2_1)^2 + ( \\Gamma \\omega )^2} \\label{3.108}$\n\nNote that since the average over $2\\pi$ of $\\cos^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, then the average over the $\\cos^2 (\\omega_1 t − \\delta)$ term gives the intensity $I(t) = \\frac{A^2}{2} e^{−\\Gamma t}$ which has a mean lifetime for the decay of $\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma}$.

Kathy Gill responded on Twitter with another article about the same topic, asserting that koalas are becoming functionally extinct. So, who should we believe?\n\nFirst of all, we should start by checking our emotions. Why is this contentious? Because koalas are cute and they may be functionally extinct and that’s sad. It might feel like David is claiming we shouldn’t care about koalas. After all, he is asserting that we shouldn’t “buy into the hype.” Is this the case, though? There is a lot here that we should stop and think about before jumping to conclusions.\n\nNext, let’s investigate who shared this information. Who is David Beard? David Beard’s bio on Twitter tells us that he used to work for the Washington Post and the Associated Press. After consulting the Washington Post’s website, we can see that this is true. So David works with news organizations, but he may or may not be a koala expert. Kathy is also not a koala expert, and instead she is a journalist and professor focusing on user experience. From their backgrounds, it seems that the individuals here are both fairly credible sources, but they aren’t the authors of these articles, just the people who shared them.\n\nWhat about their sources? David shared a link to a National Geographic article. According to Wikipedia, National Geographic is a magazine that shares “articles about science, geography, history, and world culture.” The article titled “No, Koalas are Not Functionally Extinct – Yet” cites scholars in wildlife conservation and environmental change biology at the University of Queensland Australia (Christine Adams-Hosking) and the University of Tasmania (Chris Johnson), experts who are likely closely examining this issue as it evolves. It also cites studies about the koala population from 2012 and 2016.[1]\n\nTo argue that koalas are becoming functionally extinct, Kathy shared a link to an article from Newsround. According to Wikipedia, Newsround is “one of the world’s first television news magazines aimed specifically at children.” This does not mean that Newsround is a low-quality resource, only that it might be simplifying the news to better explain it to children. We can see this within the article proper. The article states that koala numbers are in decline and may be headed toward functional extinction. In fact, despite the way Kathy presented the article in her tweet, her article appears to actually support David’s point.\n\nEvaluation breakdown\n\nHere is a breakdown of what we’ve found:\n\n• Both David and Kathy have some credibility and experience with journalism.\n• The sources that the t",

To understand that there are several techniques that can help a small business maintain a positive cash flow.\n3. To appreciate that small businesses can use sophisticated, low-cost computer accounting systems to manage their accounting and operational operations.\n\nCustomer Value\n\nOne might find at first consideration a tenuous link between a business’s accounting system and the concept of customer value. However, if looked at from the customer’s perspective, a business that provides accurate and prompt billings is a business that can control its costs, which can result in lower prices. A business that improves its overall efficiency because it can accurately monitor and track its operations provides far greater value than a business with a haphazard approach to accounting controls.\n\nThe ability to tailor a business’s operations to better meet customer needs is the key to providing value. As a business acquires a better appreciation of its capabilities, it can then make improvements that will better meet customer needs and outperform competitors.“Customer Value Analysis,” Quality Solutions, Inc., accessed December 2, 2011, www.qualitysolutions.com/customer_value_analysis.htm.\n\nAs a business grows more confident in its ability to handle accounting issues, it may wish to look at more sophisticated techniques that can better serve the business and the customer.

Unlike the example of Alex’s Soft Serve Services, not all small businesses can anticipate that they will be able to cover a negative cash flow simply by borrowing. That means that businesses must be much more proactive in attempting to eliminate or reduce negative cash flows. Therefore it is important to examine some ways in which a small business can increase its cash inflows.\n\n• Restrict credit and credit terms.

For example, bachelor is defined as an unmarried man. The word “bachelor” is the definiendum, and “an unmarried man” is the definiens. We now look at four main kinds of definitions.\n\nReportive definition\n\nA reportive definition is also known as a lexical definition. It reports the existing meaning of a term. This includes the bachelor example above, or the definition of prime number as any integer greater than one and divisible only by one and itself. A reportive definition should capture the correct usage of the term that is defined.\n\nStipulative definition\n\nA stipulative definition is not used to explain the existing meaning of a term. It assigns a new meaning to a term, whether or not the term has already got a meaning. If the stipulative definition is accepted, then the term is used in the new way that is prescribed. For example, we might stipulate “KFC” to mean “Korean-style Fried Chicken”. Once the definition is accepted,we can then say things like, “We are going to cook KFC for dinner tonight”.\n\nPrecising definition\n\nA precising definition is used to make the meaning of a term more precise for some specific purpose. For example, a bus company might want to give discounts to elderly passengers. But simply declaring that the elderly can pay a reduced fare will lead to many disputes, since it isnot clear how old one should be to qualify as an elderly person. So one might define “an elderlyperson” to mean any person of age 65 or above. This is of course one among many possible definitions. A precising definition might be seen as a combination of reportive and stipulative definition.\n\nPrecising definitions are very important in drawing up laws and regulations. We might want to eliminate or punish sexual harassment, but we need a good definition of sexual harassment to clarify what is appropriate and what is not. A biology professor who makes his students unhappy by giving a surprise exam on sexual reproduction should better not be counted as sexual harassment under any such definition.\n\nPrecising definitions can also be used to resolve disputes that involve some key concepts whose meanings might not be clear enough. Suppose two people are arguing whether animals such as birds or apes possess language. To resolve this dispute, we need to be more precise as to what is meant by language. If by language we refer to any system of communication, then obviously birds and other animals do make use of languages. On the other hand, “language” might be used in a different sense, referring to more sophisticated communication systems with a recursive syntax. If th",

Wells\n\nSooner or later, someone is going to hand you a piece of writing and ask for your opinion. You may be asked to review another student's essay as part of your class work. Perhaps a friend or a younger brother or sister has come to you for help. If you develop a reputation for being a good writer, then the chances are good that even your boss might ask you to look over letters or policy statements and offer your professional opinion. In any case, if you really want to do a good job in these situations, you're going to need reviewing skills. You're going to need to be able to identify problems, suggest alternatives, and, more importantly, support everything you say with reasonable claims. Furthermore, you must do all this in a convincing way that makes the writer want to make the changes you suggest. You must know what's wrong with a document, why it's wrong, and how to fix it.\n\nYou've probably heard the saying, \"A writer is his own worst critic.\" Whoever said this undoubtedly suffered from poor self-reviewing skills. After all, it's easier to spot problems in other people's writing because our own ego (or pride) doesn't get in the way. Another problem is that sometimes we get so caught up in what we want to get across in our writing that we don't pay enough attention to how we're expressing it -- a sentence that makes perfect sense to us might be total gibberish to someone else. Thankfully, these are all problems that can be overcome. You can learn to fairly and accurately review your own work. One way you can get better at self-reviewing is to spend time reviewing other people's work. Eventually, you'll develop a knack for spotting errors that will serve you well as you edit and revise your own work.\n\nWriters, particularly new writers, often find that letting other writers review their work is tremendously helpful. Most universities have writing centers, where students can have their essays reviewed for free by experienced student writers or tutors. These tutors can work with you one-on-one to help you improve your writing and earn better grades.\n\nYou should realize that reviewing your work, like planning, drafting, or revising, is a recursive process. It is not something a writer does just at the end of his work. For instance, you may want to write an introduction to an essay and have it reviewed by a teacher or classmate before trudging forward. If you're on the wrong track, you'd be better off knowing about it sooner rather than later -- especially if a deadline or due date is looming.\n\nIn the academic world, journal articles and books are nearly always \"peer reviewed\" before they are accepted for publication. Sometimes these reviews are \"blind,\" meaning that neither the writer nor the reviewers know each others' identities. This process is meant to make the process fair and ensure that every scholar gets a chance to get her w",

Law enforcement goals, which are bound by a moral and legal obligation to keep the peace, enforce society’s laws, protect life, and provide the framework for individuals to live free from the fear of victimization. To accomplish these ends, there are times when it is necessary for law enforcement officers to use force, including deadly force.\n\nThis constitutional power to use force against the citizenry comes with a great responsibility to use it only when necessary and justified. The law enforcement profession has made progress over time in trying to find the proper balance between restraint and the justified use of force. The process has resulted from society mandating changes, legal precedents, and forward-thinking leadership. Successful police departments sought out information regarding innovative police approaches, new technology, community input and applied them within the department to improve service to the community and protect officers.\n\nPolice managers have an obligation to ensure that officers are operating within the law, but also have a responsibility to ensure that their practices incorporate successful strategic approaches. It is essential police departments need to provide officers with resources to carry out their duty, while minimizing the risk of injury and death to the officers as well as the public. In order to accomplish the law enforcement officers mandate, police leaders must seek out efficient and innovative resources to provide to their officers. These resources include updated policies that reflect both the law and industry guidelines, strategies that incorporate modern methods based on promising best practices, integration of tactics for minimum force application and de-escalation training during a potential violent encounter.\n\nThe typical police officer is trained and prepared to mitigate physical threats, but studies indicate that only about 1% of police-civilian interactions result in physical encounters. The vast majority of conflict events involving officers consist of interpersonal disputes with little actual violence. To successfully navigate the complexities associated with these disputes, officers must have a clear understanding of conflict, must appreciate how their presence changes the conflict dynamic, and must be able to apply various communication and conflict management techniques. Departments that train their officers how to employ these techniques have the potential to provide results in positive safety and enforcement outcomes, including increased officer safety, reduced repeat calls, lower costs, greater community support and higher officer satisfaction rates.\n\nThe use of force, sometimes deadly force will always be required for law enforcement officers to meet the requirements demanded by the public and the rule of law.

In a standard bank account, any interest we earn is automatically added to our balance, and we earn interest on that interest in future years. This reinvestment of interest is called compounding.\n\nSuppose that we deposit $1000 in a bank account offering 3% interest, compounded monthly. How will our money grow? The 3% interest is an annual percentage rate (APR) – the total interest to be paid during the year. Since interest is being paid monthly, each month, we will earn $\\frac{3 \\%}{12}=0.25 \\%$ per month. In the first month, $P_{0}=\\ 1000$ $r=0.0025(0.25 \\%)$ $I=\\ 1000(0.0025)=\\ 2.50$ $A=\\ 1000+\\ 2.50=\\ 1002.50$ In the first month, we will earn$2.50 in interest, raising our account balance to $1002.50. In the second month, $P_{0}=\\ 1002.50$ $I=\\ 1002.50(0.0025)=\\ 2.51$ (rounded) $A=\\ 1000+\\ 2.50=\\ 1002.50$ Notice that in the second month we earned more interest than we did in the first month. This is because we earned interest not only on the original$1000 we deposited, but we also earned interest on the $2.50 of interest we earned the first month. This is the key advantage that compounding of interest gives us. Calculating out a few more months: $\\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline \\textbf { Month } & \\textbf { Starting balance } & \\textbf { Interest earned } & \\textbf { Ending Balance } \\ \\hline 1 & 1000.00 & 2.50 & 1002.50 \\ \\hline 2 & 1002.50 & 2.51 & 1005.01 \\ \\hline 3 & 1005.01 & 2.51 & 1007.52 \\ \\hline 4 & 1007.52 & 2.52 & 1010.04 \\ \\hline 5 & 1010.04 & 2.53 & 1012.57 \\ \\hline 6 & 1012.57 & 2.53 & 1015.10 \\ \\hline 7 & 1015.10 & 2.54 & 1017.64 \\ \\hline 8 & 1017.64 & 2.54 & 1020.18 \\ \\hline 9 & 1020.18 & 2.55 & 1022.73 \\ \\hline 10 & 1022.73 & 2.56 & 1025.29 \\ \\hline 11 & 1025.29 & 2.56 & 1027.85 \\ \\hline 12 & 1027.85 & 2.57 & 1030.42 \\ \\hline \\end{array}$ To find an equation to represent this, if $P_{m}$ represents the amount of money after $m$ months, then we could write the recursive equation: $P_{0}=\\ 1000$ $P_{m}=(1+0.0025) P_{m-1}$ You probably recognize this as the recursive form of exponential growth. If not, we could go through the steps to build an explicit equation for the growth: $P_{0}=\\ 1000$ $P_{1}=1.0025 P_{0}=1.0025(1000)$ $P_{2}=1.0025 P_{1}=1.0025(1.0025(1000))=1.0025^{2}(1000)$ $P_{3}=1.0025 P_{2}=1.0025\\left(1.0025^{2}(1000)\\right)=1.0025^{3}(1000)$ $P_{4}=1.0025 P_{3}=1.0025\\left(1.0025^{3}(1000)\\right)=1.0025^{4}(1000)$ Observing a pattern, we could conclude $P_{m}=(1.0025)^{m}(\\ 1000)$ Notice that the$1000 in the equation was $P_0$, the starting amount. We found 1.0025 by adding one to the growth rate divided by 12, since we were compounding 12 times per year.\n\nGeneralizing our result, we could write\n\n$P_{m}=P_{0}\\left(1+\\frac{r}{k}\\right)^{m}$\n\nIn this formula:\n\n$m$ is the number of compounding periods (months in our example)\n\n$r$ is the annual interest rate\n\n$k$ is the number of compounds per year.\n\nWhile this formula works fine, i",

Comparing 95 students to the 365 possible birthdays, you might guess the probability lies somewhere around $1/4$—but you’d be wrong: the probability that there will be two people in the class with matching birthdays is actually more than 0.9999.\n\nTo work this out, we’ll assume that the probability that a randomly chosen student has a given birthday is $1/d$. We’ll also assume that a class is composed of n randomly and independently selected students. Of course $d = 365$ and $n = 95$ in this case, but we’re interested in working things out in general. These randomness assumptions are not really true, since more babies are born at certain times of year, and students’ class selections are typically not independent of each other, but simplifying in this way gives us a start on analyzing the problem. More importantly, these assumptions are justifiable in important computer science applications of birthday matching. For example, birthday matching is a good model for collisions between items randomly inserted into a hash table. So we won’t worry about things like spring procreation preferences that make January birthdays more common, or about twins’ preferences to take classes together (or not).\n\nExact Formula for Match Probability\n\nThere are $d^n$ sequences of $n$ birthdays, and under our assumptions, these are equally likely. There are $d(d-1)(d-2) \\cdots (d-(n-1))$ length $n$ sequences of distinct birthdays. That means the probability that everyone has a different birthday is:3\n\n\\begin{align} \\label{16.4.1} \\nonumber &\\dfrac{d(d-1)(d-2) \\cdots(d-(n-1))}{d^{n}}\\ &=\\dfrac{d}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{d-1}{d} \\cdot \\dfrac{d-2}{d} \\cdots \\dfrac{d-(n-1)}{d}\\ \\nonumber &=\\left(1-\\dfrac{0}{d}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{d}\\right)\\left(1-\\dfrac{2}{d}\\right) \\cdots\\left(1-\\dfrac{n-1}{d}\\right)\\ \\nonumber &\\left.<e^{0} \\cdot e^{-1 / d} \\cdot e^{-2 / d} \\cdots e^{-(n-1) / d} \\quad \\text { (since } 1+x<e^{x}\\right)\\ \\nonumber &=e^{-\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i / d\\right)}\\ \\label{16.4.2} &=e^{-(n(n-1) / 2 d)}. \\end{align}\n\nFor $n = 95$ and $d = 365$, the value of (\\ref{16.4.2}) is less than $1/200,000$, which means the probability of having some pair of matching birthdays actually is more than $1 - 1/200,000 > 0.99999$. So it would be pretty astonishing if there were no pair of students in the class with matching birthdays.\n\nFor $d \\leq n^2 / 2$, the probability of no match turns out to be asymptotically equal to the upper bound (\\ref{16.4.2}). For $d \\leq n^2 / 2$ in particular, the probability of no match is asymptotically equal to $1/e$. This leads to a rule of thumb which is useful in many contexts in computer science:\n\nThe Birthday Principle\n\nIf there are $d$ days in a year and $\\sqrt{2d}$ people in a room, then the probability that two share a birthday is about $1 - 1/e \\approx 0.632$.\n\nFor example, the Birthday Principle says that if you have $\\sqrt{2 \\cdot 365} \\approx 27",

                "source_content": "A set is a collection of elements. A set is defined entirely by the elements that it contains. An element can be anything, including another set. You will notice that this is not a precise mathematical definition. Instead, it is an intuitive description of what the word “set” is supposed to mean: Any time you have a bunch of entities and you consider them as a unit, you have a set. Mathematically, sets are really defined by the operations that can be performed on them. These operations model things that can be done with collections of objects in the real world. These operations are the subject of the branch of mathematics known as set theory.\n\nThe most basic operation in set theory is forming a set from a given list of specific entities. The set that is formed in this way is denoted by enclosing the list of entities between a left brace, “{”, and a right brace, “}”. The entities in the list are separated by commas. For example, the set denoted by\n\n$\\textit{17, π, New York City, Barack Obama, Big Ben}\\nonumber$\n\nis the set that contains the entities 17, π, New York City, Barack Obama, and Big Ben. These entities are the elements of the set. Since we assume that a set is completely defined by the elements that it contains, the set is well-defined. Of course, we still haven’t said what it means to be an “entity.” Something as definite as “New York City” should qualify, except that it doesn’t seem like New York City really belongs in the world of Mathematics. The problem is that mathematics is supposed to be its own self-contained world, but it is supposed to model the real world. When we use mathematics to model the real world, we admit entities such as New York City and even Big Ben. But when we are doing mathematics per se, we’ll generally stick to obviously mathematical entities such as the integer 17 or the real number \\pi. We will also use letters such as $a$ and $b$ to refer to entities. For example, when I say something like “Let A be the set ${a, b, c}$,” I mean $a, b,$ and $c$ to be particular, but unspecified, entities.\n\nIt’s important to understand that a set is defined by the elements that it contains, and not by the order in which those elements might be listed. For example, the notations ${a,b,c,d}$ and ${b,c,a,d}$ define the same set. Furthermore, a set can only contain one copy of a given element, even if the notation that specifies the set lists the element twice. This means that ${a, b, a, a, b, c, a}$ and ${a, b, c}$ specify exactly the same set. Note in particular that it’s incorrect to say that the set ${a,b,a,a,b,c,a}$ contains seven elements, since some of the elements in the list are identical. The notation ${a,b,c}$ can lead to some confusion, since it might not be clear whether the letters $a, b, \\text{ and } c$ are assumed to refer to three different entities. A mathematician would generally not make this assumption without stating it explicitly, so that the set denoted by ${a, b, c}$ could actually contain either one, two",

Examples of workplace violence include direct physical assaults (with or without weapons), written or verbal threats, physical or verbal harassment, and homicide.[1]\n\nViolence committed by patients or family members toward health care staff can occur in many health care settings, so nurses must be prepared to cope effectively with agitated patients to reduce the risk of serious injury to the patient, themselves, staff, and other clients. Up to 50 percent of health care professionals are victims of violence at some point during their careers. There is a wide range of risk factors for patient violence, including the environment, a patient’s social and medical history, interpersonal relationships, genetics, neurochemistry and endocrine function, and substance abuse. In the emergency department (ED), substance intoxication or withdrawal is the most common diagnosis in combative patients. Known psychiatric illness is also a risk factor for violent behavior, with schizophrenia, personality disorders, mania, and psychotic depression most often associated with violence. Psychosis, delirium, and dementia can also lead to violent behavior.[2]\n\nSome states are introducing legislation to increase the penalties for people who commit violence against nurses, making battery to a nurse a felony instead of a misdemeanor. A recent law passed in Wisconsin in 2022 makes it a felony to threaten a health care worker.[3] See Figure 51.12[4] for an illustration related to stopping workplace violence for nurses in Wisconsin.\n\nAssessment of the combative patient begins with risk assessment and attention to safety measures. Violence typically erupts after a period of mounting tension. In a typical scenario, the patient first becomes angry, then resists authority, and finally becomes confrontational. However, violent behavior may erupt without warning, especially when caused by medical illness or dementia. A nurse may identify verbal and nonverbal cues of agitation and defuse the situation before violence happens. It is helpful to observe the nonverbal communication of a client’s hands as an indicator of tension. Other signs of impending violence include the following[5]:\n\n• Confrontational behavior\n• Angry demeanor\n• Loud, aggressive speech\n• Tense posturing (e.g., gripping arm rails tightly or clenching fists)\n• Frequently changing body position or pacing\n• Aggressive acts (e.g., pounding walls, throwing objects, or hitting oneself)\n\nPatients who are agitated but cooperative may be amenable to verbal de-escalation techniques. Actively violent patients and uncooperative, agitated patients, particularly those who exhibit signs of impending violence, require immediate physical restraint per an agency’s policy. Assume that all violent patients are armed until proven otherwise, especially those presenting to an emergency department.[6]\n\nRead about crisis",

                "source_content": "Insertions of $\\pi$ systems into M-X bonds are appealing in the sense that they establish two new $\\sigma$ bonds in one step, in a stereocontrolled manner. As we saw in the last post, however, we should take care to distinguish these fully intramolecular migratory insertions from intermolecular attack of a nucleophile or electrophile on a coordinated $\\pi$-system ligand. The reverse reaction of migratory insertion, $\\beta$-elimination, is not the same as the reverse of nucleophilic or electrophilic attack on a coordinated $\\pi$ system.\n\nLike 1,1-insertions, 1,2-insertions generate a vacant site on the metal, which is usually filled by external ligand. For unsymmetrical alkenes, it’s important to think about site selectivity: which atom of the alkene will end up bound to metal, and which to the other ligand? To make predictions about site selectivity we can appeal to the classic picture of the M–X bond as M + X. Asymmetric, polarized $\\pi$ ligands contain one atom with excess partial charge; this atom hooks up with the complementary atom in the M–R bond during insertion. Resonance is our best friend here!\n\nA nice study by Yu and Spencer illustrates these effects in homogeneous palladium- and rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions. Unactivated alkenes generally exhibit lower site selectivity than activated ones, although steric differences between the two ends of the double bond can promote selectivity.\n\nReactivity Trends in 1,2-Insertions\n\nThe thermodynamics of 1,2-insertions of alkenes depend strongly on the alkene, but we can gain great insight by examining the structure of the product alkyl. Coordinated alkenes that give strong metal-alkyl bonds after migratory insertion tend to undergo the process. Hence, electron-withdrawing groups, such as carbonyls and fluorine atoms, tend to encourage migratory insertion—remember that alkyl complexes bearing these groups tend to have stable M–C bonds.\n\nInsertions of alkenes into both M–H and M–R (R = alkyl) are favored thermodynamically, but the kinetics of M–R insertion are much slower. This observation reflects a pervasive trend in organometallic chemistry: M–H bonds react more rapidly than M–R bonds. The same is true of the reverse, $\\beta$-elimination. Even in cases when both hydride and alkyl elimination are thermodynamically favored, $\\beta$-hydride elimination is much faster. Although insertion into M–R is relatively slow, this elementary step is critical for olefin polymerizations that form polyalkenes (Ziegler-Natta polymerization). This reaction deserves a post all its own!\n\nAs the strength of the M–X bond increases, the likelihood that an L-type $\\pi$ ligand will insert into the bond goes down. Hence, while insertions into M–H and M–C are relatively common, insertions into M–N and M–O bonds are more rare. Lanthanides and palladium are known to promote insertion into M–N in some cases, but products with identical connectivity can come from external attack of nitrogen on a coordinated $\\pi$ lig",

It is important to use the appropriate mode for the specimen, choosing from reflected-light or transmitted-light modes.\n\nReflected-light microscopy is used for a range of materials, including metals, ceramics and composites. Contrast between different regions when viewed in reflected light can arise from variations in surface topography and differences in reflectivity (e.g. of different phases, different grain orientations, or boundary regions). These features are revealed by a series of specimen preparation techniques which, when carried out with care, can produce useful, high quality images.\n\nTransmission mode can be used when the specimen is transparent. The specimen is usually in the form of a thin slice (e.g. tens of microns thick). Contrast arises from differences in the absorption of light through different regions. This method is used for the examination of minerals and rocks, as well as glasses, ceramics and polymers. In addition, the transmission mode can often be further enhanced with use of polarised light.\n\nPolarised light microscopy is a specialised use of the transmission mode, and contrast is due to differences in birefringence and thickness of the specimen. This can allow the observation of grains, grain orientation and thickness.\n\n10.2: Sample Preparation\n\nFor Metals\n\nWhen preparing samples for microscopy, it is important to produce something that is representative of the whole specimen. It is not always possible to achieve this with a single sample. Indeed, it is always good practice to mount samples from a material under study in more than one orientation. The variation in material properties will affect how the preparation should be handled, for example very soft or ductile materials may be difficult to polish mechanically.\n\nCutting a specimen\n\nIt important to be alert to the fact that preparation of a specimen may change the microstructure of the material, for example through heating, chemical attack, or mechanical damage. The amount of damage depends on the method by which the specimen is cut and the material itself.\n\nCutting with abrasives may cause a large amount of damage, whilst the use of a low-speed diamond saw can cause fewer problems. There are many different cutting methods, although some are used only for specific specimen types.\n\nMounting\n\nMounting of specimens is usually necessary to allow them to be handled easily. It also minimises the amo",

                "source_content": "Introduction and stats\n\nTwitter is the most popular microblogging service. Microblogging is a form of blogging that allows a user to publish short text updates, usually limited to 140 characters, which can be viewed by anyone or restricted to a specific community. Twitter (www.twitter.com) was launched in July 2006. These 140-characters posts, called tweets, are usually short thoughts or links to interesting articles.\n\nNote\n\nTwitter trialled using 280 characters in 2017. You can find out more here: www.nytimes. com/2017/09/26/ technology/twitter280-characters.html\n\nTwitter boasts over 328 million monthly active users, with 100 million of those active daily sharing over 500 million tweets every day. Twitter was thought to be a platform for older users, but latest stats show that nearly 40% of users are between 18 and 29 years old, compared to around 30% of users being between 30 and 49 years old. Twitter is definitely a platform that users access on the go, with over 80% of Twitter users accessing the site from their mobile phone (Omnicore, 2017b)\n\nFeatures\n\nEach user on Twitter will have a unique username denoted with @ and their chosen name, for example, @robstokes for www.twitter.com/robstokes. Tweets can be directed to a specific user simply by typing their @username at the start of the tweet. This is also known as their twitter handle.\n\nNote\n\nThe hashtag was first used in 2007, and used so that users could track the online communications and discussions about a specific event, Barcamp. The #barcamp is thus the first use of the hashtag in social media.\n\nLike Instagram, Twitter users use hashtags to categorise their posts by adding a word or phrase prefaced with the # symbol for example, #DigitalMarketing. The hashtag will become a link that you can click to see other tweets that share this tag. Users can also choose to follow a hashtag, meaning that they will see all public messages with that tag, whether they follow the user who posted it or not. This can be a very useful way of collating information at events such as conferences. If you’re not at the event, you can still follow messages from the event by following the hashtag. For those at the event, all tagged messages can be broadcast in a shared location.\n\nIf a hashtag or keyword is used very frequently in a short time, it can become a trending topic and is displayed to the left of a user’s tweet stream. Events of global interest usually feature heavily, but sometimes brands can trend too (although not always for the right reasons). If a tweet is considered noteworthy, it can be retweeted or quote retweeted. Retweeting means reposting somebody else’s tweet to your own profile, along with their username. Twitter automatically displays this as a retweet. A quote retweet allows you to retweet another post, and include a comment about the tweet as well.\n\nMarketing and advertising with Twitter\n\nTwitter has become a popular and important marketing tool for many organisations, brands and individ",

Portner (2011) and Ritz (2012) provide good overviews of the empirical challenges and competing analyses for the perfect.\n\nDiscussion exercises\n\nA.

Advancements in science have provided new tools to protect the public health. At times, public health crises have compelled urgent changes, and at other times, reform has taken place slowly through a length and controlled administrative process. Through it all, FDA's steadfast commitment to protecting the public health has remained at the core of all regulatory action.\n• 4.2: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nThe FDA is an administrative agency created to regulate food and drug supplies in the United States for the safety and health of its citizens. FDA is an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. While the FDA has traditionally focused on the US markets, with the global market growth (of imports and exports of products and raw materials) the FDA now manages over 2 trillion dollars of goods manufactured in over 150 nations worldwide (FDA, FDA Global engagement report, 2016).\n• 4.3: The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)\nThe CFR is a massive set of regulations, published annually, where all the federal agencies post their rules. It provides information (based on quality techniques) on quality systems in the laboratory (QSR), manufacturing practices, laboratory practices, and clinical practices. Due to the sheer volume of information available through the CFR, it is useful to know how it is organized. \n\n04: The Food and Drug Administration \n\nThe idea of protecting the safety and health of consumers isn’t new. From the beginnings of civilization, people have been concerned about the quality and safety of foods and medicines. In 1202, King John of England proclaimed the first English food law, the Assize of Bread, which prohibited adulteration of bread with such ingredients as ground peas or beans. Regulation of food in the United States dates from early colonial times. Federal controls over the drug supply began with inspection of imported drugs in 1848, although the first federal biologics law, which addressed the provision of reliable smallpox vaccine to citizens, was passed in 1813.\n\nThe revolting condition of the meat-packing industry that Upton Sinclair captured in The Jungle (right) led to a meat inspection law and a comprehensive food and drug law, now known as the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of 1906. In this chapter, we will examine some of the most significant regulations, explore how regulations come to pass, and discuss the role of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in regulations of consumer products.\n\nTh",

However, many individuals have lost faith in the banking system, and who’s to blame them? Big banks have let the general consumer down with security breaches and countless stories of scandals. One glaring example is Wells Fargo & Co., who are still recovering their brand from their admission of creating nearly two million accounts for customers without their permission. But this problem is not new. The approach to bolstering this trust factor is, however, taking on a new perspective with some quick adaptation and managerial foresight.\n\nOne CEO, Cathie Mahon, chief executive officer of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, is not taking the disparities between credit unions and big banks lying down. Credit unions have always operated differently from big banks, and one key factor is that they are nonprofit while their big-bank counterparts are for-profit enterprises. This also can mean that they offer higher interest rates on deposits due to their size. Mahon has begun a keen undertaking to educate and empower low-income residents about financial resources. Her most recent endeavor is to provide a platform called CU Impact that keeps customers more informed about their balances, creates more trustworthy auto-pay features, more information delivered at ATMs as well. The improvements to the back-end reliability within the credit union system sustain the small, community feel of the credit union, while providing powerful, trustworthy systems that restore faith in their business. Her willingness to embrace technology and embrace differences of customers, employees, and the company structure overall made her the key to success for the future of their business.\n\nSources: Cohen, Arianne, “The CEO Who’s Leveling the Playing Field Between Credit Unions and Big Banks,” Bloomberg Businessweek, July 9, 2018, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-09/ the-ceo-who-s-leveling-the-playing-field-between-credit-unions-and-big-banks; Koren, James Rufus, “It’s been a year since the Wells Fargo scandal broke—and new problems are still surfacing,” Los Angeles Times, September 8, 2017, ",

Describe behaviors that effective leaders demonstrate.\n3. Specify the contexts in which various leadership styles are effective.\n4. Explain the concepts of transformational, transactional, charismatic, servant, and authentic leadership.\n5. Develop your own leadership skills.\n\nPerhaps this is obvious, but leadership is the first of five facets constituting a manager’s leading function in the P-O-L-C framework. Leadership may be defined as the act of influencing others to work toward a goal. Leaders exist at all levels of an organization. Some leaders hold a position of authority and may use the power that comes from their position, as well as their personal power, to influence others; they are called formal leaders. In contrast, informal leaders are without a formal position of authority within the organization but demonstrate leadership by influencing others through personal forms of power. One caveat is important here: Leaders do not rely on the use of force to influence people. Instead, people willingly adopt the leader’s goal as their own goal. If a person is relying on force and punishment, the person is a dictator, not a leader.\n\nWhat makes leaders effective? What distinguishes people who are perceived as leaders from those who are not perceived as leaders? More importantly, how do we train future leaders and improve their leadership ability? These are important questions that have attracted scholarly attention in the past several decades. In this chapter, we will review the history of leadership studies and summarize the major findings relating to these important questions. Around the world, we view leaders as at least partly responsible for their team’s or company’s success and failure. Company chief executive officers (CEOs) are paid millions of dollars in salaries and stock options with the assumption that they hold their company’s future in their hands. In politics, education, sports, and profit and nonprofit sectors, influence of leaders over the behaviors of individuals and organizations is rarely questioned. When people and organizations fail, managers and CEOs are often viewed as responsible. Some people criticize the assumption that leadership always matters and call this belief “the romance of leadership.” However, research evidence pointing to the importance of leaders for organizational success is accumulating (Hogan, et. al., 1994).\n\n10.2: Case in Point: Indra Nooyi Draws on Vision and Values to Lead\n\nFigure 10.3\n\nShe is among the top 100 most influential people according to Time magazine’s 2008 list.

State the function of ATP synthases in chemiosmosis.\n6. State the final electron acceptor and the end product formed at the end of aerobic respiration.\n\nDuring various steps in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, the oxidation of certain intermediate precursor molecules causes the reduction of NAD+ to NADH + H+ and FAD to FADH2. NADH and FADH2 then transfer protons and electrons to the electron transport chain to produce additional ATPs by oxidative phosphorylation .\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section on energy, during the process of aerobic respiration, coupled oxidation-reduction reactions and electron carriers are often part of what is called an electron transport chain , a series of electron carriers that eventually transfers electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen. The diffusible electron carriers NADH and FADH2 carry hydrogen atoms (protons and electrons) from substrates in exergonic catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle to other electron carriers that are embedded in membranes. These membrane-associated electron carriers include flavoproteins, iron-sulfur proteins, quinones, and cytochromes. The last electron carrier in the electron transport chain transfers the electrons to the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen.\n\nThe chemiosmotic theory explains the functioning of electron transport chains. According to this theory, the transfer of electrons down an electron transport system through a series of oxidation-reduction reactions releases energy (Figure \\(1\\)). This energy allows certain carriers in the chain to transport hydrogen ions (H+ or protons) across a membrane.\n\nDepending on the type of cell, the electron transport chain may be found in the cytoplasmic membrane or the inner membrane of mitochondria.\n\n• In prokaryotic cells, the protons are transported from the cytoplasm of the bacterium across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasmic space located between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cell wall .\n• In eukaryotic cells, protons are transported from the matrix of the mitochondria across the inner mitochondrial membrane to the intermembrane space located between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Figure \\(2\\)).\n\nAs the hydrogen ions accumulate on one side of a membrane, the concentration of hydrogen ions creates an electrochemical gradient or potential difference (voltage) across the membrane. (The fluid on the side of the membrane where the protons accumulate acquires a positive charge; the fluid on the opposite side of the membrane is left with a negative charge.)

In many ways money drives almost all of our endeavors. Consider why you are here taking this course. You are obtaining knowledge in order to get a better job, to obtain a degree or other credential, or to be more informed in your daily life so that you can support yourself and provide for those you love. Even if you are interested in charitable endeavors to improve the human condition, such efforts to support a cause will require money—even indirectly. Understanding how money functions—the different forms it takes and where it goes—is the first step in being able to comprehend our financial system.\n\n4.02: Market\n\nWhat you’ll learn to do: explain what money is and what makes it useful\n\nWhen we think of money, the paper bills in our wallet or the coins that are in our pockets come to mind. But money is much more than that, and how we define money determines where and how we use it to obtain the goods and services that businesses offer the consumer. In this section we’ll look at what money is, why it’s useful, and what may be the future of money.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n• Discuss the advantages of using money versus barter\n• Discuss alternatives to traditional currency used today\n\nWhat Is Money?\n\nMoney is really anything that people use to pay for goods and services and to pay people for their work. Historically, money has taken different forms in different cultures—everything from salt, stones, and beads to gold, silver, and copper coins and, more recently, virtual currency has been used. Regardless of the form it takes, money needs to be widely accepted by both buyers and sellers in order to be useful.\n\nBarter and the Double Coincidence of Wants\n\nTo understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system. Barter—literally trading one good or service for another—is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide. For example, if a hairstylist wants a pair of shoes, she must find a shoemaker who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for a certain number of hairdos. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different jobs and goods.\n\nAnother problem with the barter system is that it doesn’t a",

If all of the balls were the same color there would only be one distinguishable permutation in lining them up in a row because the balls themselves would look the same no matter how they were arranged.\n\nIf 10 of the balls were yellow and the other 5 balls are all different colors, how many distinguishable permutations would there be?\n\nNo matter how the balls are arranged, because the 10 yellow balls are indistinguishable from each other, they could be interchanged without any perceptable change in the overall arrangement. As a result, the number of distinguishable permutations in this case would be $\\frac{15 !}{10 !},$ since there are $10 !$ rearrangements of the yellow balls for each fixed position of the other balls.\n\nThe general rule for this type of scenario is that, given $n$ objects in which there are $n_{1}$ objects of one kind that are indistinguishable, $n_{2}$ objects of another kind that are indistinguishable and so on, then number of distinguishable permutations will be:\n$\\begin{array}{c} n ! \\ \\frac{n}{n_{1} ! * n_{2} ! * n_{3} ! * \\cdots * n_{k} !} \\ \\text { with } n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}+\\cdots+n_{k}=n \\end{array}$\nExample\nFind the number of ways of placing 12 balls in a row given that 5 are red, 3 are green and 4 are yellow.\nThis would be $\\frac{12 !}{5 ! 3 ! 4 !}=\\frac{12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1}{5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 3 * 2 * 4 * 3 * 2}$\n$\\begin{array}{l} =\\frac{12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6}{3 * 2 * 4 * 3 * 2} \\ =27,720 \\end{array}$\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is to choose five of the twelve spaces in which to place the red balls - since the order of selection is not important, there are $_{12} C_{5}$ ways to do this. Then, from the remaining 7 spaces available, we need to choose three of them in which to place the green balls. There are $_{7} C_{3}$ ways to do that. The four yellow balls are then placed in the remaining four spaces.\n\nThe result of this process is that there are $_{12} C_{5}$ ways to choose the places for the red balls and $_{7} C_{3}$ ways to choose the places for the green balls, which results in:\n$_{12} C_{5} *_{7} C_{3}=\\frac{12 !}{5 ! 7 !} * \\frac{7 !}{3 ! 4 !}=\\frac{12 !}{5 ! 3 ! 4 !}$\nThis results in the same answer as when we approached the problem as a permutation. Considering the problem in this way helps us to solve problems which involve the assigning of tasks to groups of individuals.\nExample\nFourteen construction workers are to be assigned to three different tasks. Six workers are needed for mixing cement, five for laying bricks and three for carrying the bricks to the brick layers. In how many different ways can the workers be assigned to these tasks?\n\nThis is also a problem of distinguishable permutation.

The strategy involves charging a high price initially, then lowering price after time passes. Many technology products and recently-released products follow this strategy.\n\nIntertemporal Price Discrimination = charging a high price initially, then lowering price after time passes.\n\nIntertemporal price discrimination is similar to second degree price discrimination, but charges a different price across time. Second degree price discrimination charges a different price for different quantities at the same time. Intertemporal price discrimination is shown in Figure \\(1\\).\n\nThe first group has a higher willingness to pay for the good, as shown by demand curve \\(D_1\\). This group will pay the higher initial price charged by the firm. A new iPhone release is a good example. Over time, Apple will lower the price to capture additional consumer groups, such as group two in Figure \\(1\\). In this fashion, the firm will extract a larger amount of consumer surplus than with a single price.\n\nIntertemporal price discrimination can also be shown in a slightly different graph. The key feature of intertemporal price discrimination is a high initial price, followed by lower prices charged over time, as shown in Figure \\(2\\). In this graph, the firm initially charges price Pt to capture the high willingness to pay of some consumers. Over time, the firm lowers price to \\(P_{t+1}\\), and later to \\(P_{t+2}\\) to capture consumer groups with lower willingness to pay.\n\nThe concept of intertemporal price discrimination explains why new products are often priced at high prices, and the price is lowered over time. In the next section, peak-load pricing will be introduced.\n\n4.04: Peak Load Pricing\n\nThe demand for many goods is larger during certain times of the day or week. For example, roads are congested during rush hours during the morning and evening commutes. Electricity has larger demand during the day than at night. Ski resorts have large (peak) demands during the weekends, and smaller demand during the week.\n\nPeak Load Pricing = Charging a high price during demand peaks, and a lower price during off-peak time periods.\n\nFigure \\(1\\) demonstrates the demand for electricity during the day. Demand curve \\(D_1\\) represents demand at off-peak hours at night. The electricity utility company will charge a price \\(P_1\\) for the off-peak hours. The costs of producing electricity increase dramatically during peak hours. Electricity generation reaches the capacity of the generating plants, causing larger quantities of electricity to be expensive to produce. For large coal-fired plants, when capacity is reached, the firm will use natural gas to generate the peak demand. To cover these higher costs, the firm will charge the higher price \\(P_2\\) during peak hours. The same graph represents a large number of other goods that have peak demand at different times durin",

However, the second law of thermodynamics puts a limitation on this. To go from work to heat is called dissipation and there is no limitation on this at all. In fact it was through dissipation (by friction) that we discovered that heat and work were both forms of energy. There is, however, a limitation on converting heat to work.\n\nThe Carnot Cycle\n\nLet's consider a circular, reversible path of an ideal gas on a PV diagram:\n\nThis cycle forms the 4-stage Carnot cycle heat engine. A heat engine converts heat energy into work. The cycle consists of:\n\n1. Isothermal expansion at the hot temperature, $T_h$: $\\Delta U_1=w_1+q_h=0 \\nonumber$\n2. Adiabatic cooling from $T_h$ to $T_c$: $\\Delta U_2=w_2 \\nonumber$\n3. Isothermal compression at the cold temperature, $T_c$: $\\Delta U_3=w_3+q_c=0 \\nonumber$\n4. Adiabatic heating from $T_c$ to $T_h$: $\\Delta U_4=w_4 \\nonumber$\n\nThe total four-step process produces work because $w_{hot} > w_{cold}$. The work is the integral under the upper isotherm minus the one under the lower curve, i.e.the surface area in between.\n\nSadi Carnot\n\nSadi Carnot was a French engineer at the beginning of the 19th century. He considered a cyclic process involving a cylinder filled with gas. This cycle the Carnot cycle contributed greatly to the development of thermodynamics and the improvement of the steam engine. Carnot demonstrated that the cold temperature on the right is as important as the heat source on the left in defining the possible efficiency of a heat engine\n\nEfficiency\n\nOf course we spend good money on the fuel to start the cycle by heating things up. So how much work do we get for the heat we put in? In other words, we want to know how efficient our heat engine is. The efficiency, $\\eta$ of a heat engine is:\n\n$\\eta=\\frac{|w_\\text{cycle}|}{q_h}=\\frac{q_h+q_c}{q_h}=1+\\frac{q_c}{q_h} \\nonumber$\n\nTo get the work of the cycle, we can make use of internal energy as a state function. As the path is circular the circular integrals for $U$ is zero:\n\n\\begin{align*} \\oint{dU} &= \\Delta U_{\\text{cycle}} \\[4pt] &=\\sum{\\Delta U_i} \\[4pt] &=w_1+q_h+w_2+w_3+q_c+w_4 \\[4pt] &=0 \\end{align*}\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\begin{align*} q_h + q_c &=-w_1-w_2-w_3-w_4 \\[4pt] &=-w_\\text{cycle} \\end{align*}\n\nAn ideal engine would take $q_h\\rightarrow q_c$ with 100% efficiency. The work of the cycle will be equivalent to the heat transfer. For ideal gases:\n\n1. $w_1=-RT_h\\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_B}{V_A}\\right)}=-q_h$\n2. $dU=\\delta w=\\bar{C}_VdT\\rightarrow w_2={\\bar{C}}_V\\left(T_c-T_h\\right)$\n3. $w_3=-RT_c\\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_C}\\right)}=-q_c$\n4. $w_4={\\bar{C}}_V\\left(T_h-T_c\\right)$\n\nFinding an expression for $w_\\text{cycle}$:\n\n$\\begin{split} w_\\text{cycle} &= -RT_h\\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_B}{V_A}\\right)}+{\\bar{C}}_V\\left(T_c-T_h\\right)-RT_c\\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_C}\\right)}+{\\bar{C}}_V\\left(T_h-T_c\\right) \\ &= -RT_h\\ln{\\left(\\frac{V_B}{V_A}\\right)}-R",

                "source_content": "We already began examining Developmental Genetics and and got a taste of the complexity of genetic interactions. For example, the Drosophila gene Bicoid is transcribed into mRNA in maternal cells and pumped into the embryo. There its expression is regulated by localization signals on the mRNA, as well as degradation and localization of the protein. Bicoid protein itself acts as both a regulator of transcription and translation of downstream genes. The end effect is an embryo with different genes expressed along the A/P axis.\n\nNow we will take a step back and look at a broader picture of Developmental Genetics, from the point of view of signaling pathways. A signaling pathway allows cells to communicate with their external environment. In Developmental Biology, this is usually cell-cell interactions. These kinds of interactions are incredibly important because each cell needs to follow its own developmental trajectory in coordination with all the cells around it. For example, imagine a growing mammalian limb bud. Each cell in the limb bud needs to know if it is on the thumb or pinky side of the limb and how close to the body it is. Not only that, it also needs to know how long development has progressed. Imagine if an osteogenic cell started forming bone matrix early in limb development. It would not undergo enough cell divisions to make the correct number of osteoblasts, leading to too little bone and an animal with a malformed limb.\n\nThe Genetic Toolkit\n\n(An introductory PDF can be found here: Rediscovering Biology www.learner.org/courses/biology/pdf/7_gendev.pdf)\n\nOne of the major findings of Evo-Devo is that organisms share a common set of genes to build their very diverse bodies. In particular, animals share a suite of \"body plan\" genes that perform similar functions in development. Mixing and matching different gene expression patterns across tissue and cell types seems to be the primary mechanism for generating the unique bodies we see in each animal phylum. Novel evolutionary features (like spines, feathers, chambered hearts, tentacles, etc) appear to rely on the reuse of toolkit genes at new times and places in development (see Endless Forms for more details). Below, we will start to take a look at the genetics behind this genetic toolkit - how do these genes interact with each other?\n\nIn Evo/Devo, there are two main ways we can think about genetic interactions, but since they are interconnected so we will consider both simultaneously. One is Signal Transduction Pathways, which have an external signal (in Developmental Biology this is usually a secreted protein) that is usually received by a cell-membrane receptor that only certain cells express. When the ligand (secreted protein) and receptor bind, this triggers a cascade of protein modifications that lead to transcriptional activation of downstream genes (Figure 1).\n\nThe second way Evo/Devo thinks about signaling is Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). This includes the signal transduction ",

This first appeared in the ecological literature in the 1920s and is defined not just in terms of the interactions among species, but also in terms of the species’ carrying capacities, as follows.\n\n$\\frac{1}{N_1}\\frac{dN_1}{dt}\\,=\\,r_1(1-\\frac{N_1+a_{1,2}N_2}{K_1})$\n\n$\\frac{1}{N_2}\\frac{dN_2}{dt}\\,=\\,r_2(1-\\frac{N_2+a_{2,1}N_1}{K_2})$\n\n$K_1$ and $K_2$ are the carrying capacities for Species 1 and 2, respectively. Parameters $a_{1,2}$ and $a_{2,1}$ represent the interference by each species on the other. If $a_{1,2}=2$, for example, each individual of Species 2 interferes with the growth of Species 1 as if it were two individuals of Species 1. If, on the other hand, $a_{1,2}=1/2$, it takes two individuals of Species 2 to have the same negative effect on the growth of Species 1 as one individual of Species 1 itself.\n\nTo compare this with the RSN formulation, represent Equations 16.7.1 and 16.7.2 with $i$ and $j$ subscripts\n\n$\\frac{1}{N_i}\\frac{dN_i}{dt}\\,=\\,r_i(1-\\frac{N_i+a_{i,j}N_j}{K_i})$\n\nand multiply the right hand side through by $r_i$,\n\n$\\frac{1}{N_i}\\frac{dN_i}{dt}\\,=\\,r_i\\,-\\frac{r_i}{K_i}N_i\\,-\\frac{a_{i,j}r_i}{K_i}N_j$\n\nThis shows that the Lotka–Volterra formulation is isomorphic to the RSN formulation. All conclusions about competitive systems examined thus far apply to the Lotka–Volterra formulation as well, with the appropriate translation of parameters. Parameter $r_i$ is the same in both in the Lotka–Volterra formulation and the RSN formulation, but $s_{i,i}= −r_i/K_i$ and $s_{i,j}=−a_{i,j}r_i/K_i$.\n\nBeware, however, of a widely quoted statement derived from this formulation that appears throughout the ecological literature and textbooks. Statements like “Coexistence requires that each species inhibit itself more than it inhibits the other species” are abundant in textbooks and in the ecological literature. Alas, those statements are not correct.\n\nbox $2$\n\nCoexistence in the Lotka–Volterra model requires that each species be able to increase from low densities when the other species is at its single-species equilibrium.\n\nTo see this, examine Figure 16.21. Here Species 1 inhibits itself with s11 =−1, while it inhibits the other species more strongly with s12 =−1.153. Yet there is global coexistence. Evidently, coexistence does not require that each species inhibit itself more than it inhibits the other, as in the conventional wisdom. The confusion in the literature has apparently emerged from the presence of the carrying capacity terms, K1 and K2, in the Lotka–Volterra formulation. These terms obscure the effects of the interaction terms, a1,2 and a2,1, when carrying capacities differ between the species.\n\nWhat, then, is a correct statement about coexistence? It can be put in terms of increasing from low densities, as shown in Box $2$. The qualifying phrase “from low densities” is required, because the species not present can increase fr",

As a young man, he studied in Paris, where he began to publish his poetry and founded a literary magazine called L'Étudiant Noir (The Black Student). In 1939, he and his wife Suzanne moved back to Martinique, where he taught school, and they founded a literary magazine devoted to Martinican writers called Tropiques. In 1945, Césaire, a Communist, was elected mayor of Fort-de-France, Martinique. He later served in the French National Assembly for Martinique and as President of the Regional Council of Martinique. He retired from politics in 2001 and died from a heart attack in 2008. Césaire's works are political, and are particularly concerned with postcolonial issues of identity, especially for those who, like him, were negotiating the intersections of African, Caribbean, and French cultures. He helped to establish the movement in literature and politics called Negritude, which celebrated black history and culture. His works blend surrealist techniques with polemical messages. His greatest works are considered to be Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (first published in Spanish 1942; original French version, translated as Memorandum on My Martinique, 1947) and a dramatic trilogy that also explores postcolonial themes: La Tragédie du roi Christophe (published 1963, produced 1964; translated as The Tragedy of King Christophe, 1970), Une Saison au Congo (published 1965; translated as A Season in the Congo, 1968; produced 1976), and Une Tempête (published and produced 1969; translated as A Tempest, 1985).

                "source_content": "Learning Objectives\n\n• Use conversion factors to express the value of a given quantity in different units.\n\nIt is often necessary to convert from one unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook, some quantities may be expressed in units of liters and you need to convert them to cups. Or perhaps you are reading walking directions from one location to another and you are interested in how many miles you will be walking. In this case, you may need to convert units of feet or meters to miles.\n\nLet’s consider a simple example of how to convert units. Suppose we want to convert 80 m to kilometers. The first thing to do is to list the units you have and the units to which you want to convert. In this case, we have units in meters and we want to convert to kilometers. Next, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio that expresses how many of one unit are equal to another unit. For example, there are 12 in. in 1 ft, 1609 m in 1 mi, 100 cm in 1 m, 60 s in 1 min, and so on. Refer to Appendix B for a more complete list of conversion factors. In this case, we know that there are 1000 m in 1 km. Now we can set up our unit conversion. We write the units we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor so the units cancel out, as shown:\n\n$80\\; \\cancel{ m} \\times \\frac{1\\; km}{1000\\; \\cancel{ m}} = 0.080\\; km \\ldotp$\n\nNote that the unwanted meter unit cancels, leaving only the desired kilometer unit. You can use this method to convert between any type of unit. Now, the conversion of 80 m to kilometers is simply the use of a metric prefix, as we saw in the preceding section, so we can get the same answer just as easily by noting that\n\n$80\\; m = 8.0 \\times 10^{1}\\;m = 8.0 \\times 10^{−2}\\; km = 0.080\\; km,$\n\nsince “kilo-” means 103 and 1 = −2 + 3. However, using conversion factors is handy when converting between units that are not metric or when converting between derived units, as the following examples illustrate.\n\nExample $1$: Converting Nonmetric Units to Metric\n\nThe distance from the university to home is 10 mi and it usually takes 20 min to drive this distance. Calculate the average speed in meters per second (m/s). (Note: Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst we calculate the average speed using the given units, then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factors and multiplying by them. The correct conversion factors are those that cancel the unwanted units and leave the desired units in their place. In this case, we want to convert miles to meters, so we need to know the fact that there are 1609 m in 1 mi. We also want to convert minutes to seconds, so we use the conversion of 60 s in 1 min.\n\nSolution\n1. Calculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a given for now. Average speed and other motion concepts are cov",

However, it is usually easier to determine this direction with Lenz’s law, named in honor of its discoverer, Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865). (Faraday also discovered this law, independently of Lenz.) We state Lenz’s law as follows:\n\nLenz's Law\n\nThe direction of the induced emf drives current around a wire loop to always oppose the change in magnetic flux that causes the emf.\n\nLenz’s law can also be considered in terms of conservation of energy. If pushing a magnet into a coil causes current, the energy in that current must have come from somewhere. If the induced current causes a magnetic field opposing the increase in field of the magnet we pushed in, then the situation is clear. We pushed a magnet against a field and did work on the system, and that showed up as current. If it were not the case that the induced field opposes the change in the flux, the magnet would be pulled in produce a current without anything having done work. Electric potential energy would have been created, violating the conservation of energy.\n\nTo determine an induced emf $\\epsilon$, you first calculate the magnetic flux $\\Phi_m$ and then obtain $d\\Phi_m/dt$. The magnitude of $\\epsilon$ is given by\n\n$\\epsilon = \\left|\\dfrac{d\\Phi_m}{dt}\\right|.$\n\nFinally, you can apply Lenz’s law to determine the sense of $\\epsilon$. This will be developed through examples that illustrate the following problem-solving strategy.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategy: Lenz’s Law\n\nTo use Lenz’s law to determine the directions of induced magnetic fields, currents, and emfs:\n\n• Make a sketch of the situation for use in visualizing and recording directions.\n• Determine the direction of the applied magnetic field $\\vec{B}$.\n• Determine whether its magnetic flux is increasing or decreasing.\n• Now determine the direction of the induced magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. The induced magnetic field tries to reinforce a magnetic flux that is decreasing or opposes a magnetic flux that is increasing. Therefore, the induced magnetic field adds or subtracts to the applied magnetic field, depending on the change in magnetic flux.\n• Use right-hand rule 2 (RHR-2; see Magnetic Forces and Fields) to determine the direction of the induced current I that is responsible for the induced magnetic field $\\vec{B}$.\n• The direction (or polarity) of the induced emf can now drive a conventional current in this direction.\n\nLet’s apply Lenz’s law to the system of Figure $\\PageIndex{1a}$.

To understand this on a more general basis, let’s explicitly list some assumptions about the electric field and see how they lead to the existence and properties of a magnetic field:\n\n1. Definition of the electric field: In the frame of reference of an inertial observer $o$, take some standard, charged test particle, release it at rest, and observe the force $F_o$ (section 4.5) acting on the particle. (The timelike component of this force vanishes.) Then the electric field three-vector $E$ in frame $o$ is defined by $F_o = qE$, where we fix our system of units by taking some arbitrary value for the charge $q$ of the test particle.\n2. Definition of electric charge: For charges other than the standard test charge, we take Gauss’s law to be our definition of electric charge.\n3. Charge is Lorentz invariant (section 1.3).\n4. Fields must have transformation laws (section 10.2). Many times already in our study of relativity, we’ve followed the strategy of taking a Galilean vector and trying to redefine it as a four-dimensional vector in relativity. Let’s try to do this with the electric field. Then we would have no other obvious thing to try than to change its definition to $F = qE$, where $F = ma$ is the relativistic force vector (section 4.5), so that the electric field three-vector was just the spacelike part of $E$. Because $a\\cdot v = 0$ for a material particle, this would imply that $E$ was orthogonal to o for any observer o. But this is impossible, since then a spacetime displacement vector s along the direction of $E$ would be a vector of simultaneity for all observers, and we know that this isn’t possible in relativity.\n\nThe magnetic field\n\nOur situation is very similar to the one encountered in section 9.1, where we found that knowledge of the charge density in one frame was insufficient to tell us the charge density in other frames. There was missing information, which turned out to be the current density. The problems we’ve encountered in defining the transformation properties of the electric field suggest a similar “missing-information” situation, and it seems likely that the missing information is the magnetic field. How should we modify the assumptions above to allow for the existence of a magnetic field in addition to the electric one? What properties could this additional field have? How would we define or measure it?\n\nOne way of imagining a new type of field would be if, in addition to charge $q$, particles had some other characteristic, call it $r$, and there was then be some entirely separate field defined by their action on a particle with this “r-ness.” But going down this road leads us to unrelated phenomena such as the the strong nuclear interaction.\n\nThe electromagnetic field",

A point where two sides meet is called a vertex of the triangle, and the angle formed is called an angle of the triangle. The symbol for triangle is $\\triangle$.\n\nThe triangle in Figure $1$ is denoted by $\\triangle ABC$ (or $\\triangle BCA$ or $\\triangle CAB$, etc.).\n\n• Its sides are $AB$, $AC$, and $BC$.\n• Its vertices are $A, B$, and $C$.\n• Its angles are $\\angle A$, $\\angle B$, and $\\angle C$.\n\nThe triangle is the most important figure in plane geometry, This is because figures with more than three sides can always be divided into triangles (Figure $2$). If we know the properties of a triangle, we can extend this knowledge to the study of other figures as well.\n\nA fundamental property of triangles is the following:\n\nTheorem $1$\n\nThe sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$ of Figure $1$, $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = 180^{\\circ}$.\n\nExample $1$\n\nFind $\\angle C$:\n\nSolution\n\n$\\begin{array} {rcl} {\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C} & = & {180^{\\circ}} \\ {40^{\\circ} + 60^{\\circ} + \\angle C} & = & {180^{\\circ}} \\ {100^{\\circ} + \\angle C} & = & {180^{\\circ}} \\ {\\angle C} & = & {180^{\\circ} - 100^{\\circ}} \\ {\\angle C} & = & {80^{\\circ}} \\end{array} \\nonumber$\n\nAnswer: $\\angle C = 80^{\\circ}$\n\nProof of Theorem $1$: Through $C$ draw $DE$ parallel to $AB$ (see Figure $3$). Note that we are using the parallel postulate here, $\\angle 1 = \\angle A$ and $\\angle 3 = \\angle B$ because they are alternate interior angles of parallel lines, Therefore $\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C = \\angle 1 + \\angle 3 + \\angle 2 = 180^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe may verify Theorem $1$ by measuring the angles of a triangle with a protractor and taking the sum, However no measuring instrument is perfectly accurate, It is reasonable to expect an answer such as $179^{\\circ}$, $182^{\\circ}$, $180.5^{\\circ}$, etc. The purpose of our mathematical proof is to assure us that the sum of the angles of every triangle must be exactly $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nExample $2$\n\nFind $x$:\n\nSolution\n\n$\\begin{array} {rcl} {\\angle A + \\angle B + \\angle C} & = & {180^{\\circ}} \\ {2x + 3x + 4x} & = & {180} \\ {9x} & = & {180} \\ {x} & = & {20} \\end{array} \\nonumber$\n\nCheck:\n\nAnswer: $x = 20$.\n\nExample $3$\n\nFind $y$ and $x$:\n\nSolution\n\n$\\begin{array} {rcl} {50 + 100 + y} & = & {180} \\ {150 + y} & = & {180} \\ {y} & = & {180 - 150} \\ {y} & = & {30} \\ {} & & {} \\ {x} & = & {180 - 30 = 150} \\end{array}$\n\nAnswer: $y = 30$, $x = 150$.\n\nIn Figure $4$, $\\angle x$ is called an exterior angle of $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle A$, $\\angle B$, and $\\angle y$ are called the interior angles of $\\triangle ABC$. $\\angle A$ and $\\angle B$ are said to be the interior angles remote from the exterior angle $\\angle x$.\n\nThe results of Example $3$ suggest the following theorem.\n\nTheorem $2$\n\nAn exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles,\n\nIn Figure $4$, $\\angle x =",

However, measure-theoretic ideas are essential for a deep understanding of probability, since probability is itself a measure. The most important of the definitions is the $\\sigma$-algebra, a collection of subsets of a set with certain closure properties. Such collections play a fundamental role, even for applied probability, in encoding the state of information about a random experiment.\n\nOn the other hand, we won't be overly pedantic about measure-theoretic details in this text. Unless we say otherwise, we assume that all sets that appear are measurable (that is, members of the appropriate $\\sigma$-algebras), and that all functions are measurable (relative to the appropriate $\\sigma$-algebras).\n\nAlthough this section is somewhat abstract, many of the proofs are straightforward. Be sure to try the proofs yourself before reading the ones in the text.\n\nAlgebras and $\\sigma$-Algebras\n\nSuppose that $S$ is a set, playing the role of a universal set for a particular mathematical model. It is sometimes impossible to include all subsets of $S$ in our model, particularly when $S$ is uncountable. In a sense, the more sets that we include, the harder it is to have consistent theories. However, we almost always want the collection of admissible subsets to be closed under the basic set operations. This leads to some important definitions.\n\nAlgebras of Sets\n\nSuppose that $\\mathscr S$ is a nonempty collection of subsets of $S$. Then $\\mathscr S$ is an algebra (or field) if it is closed under complement and union:\n\n1. If $A \\in \\mathscr S$ then $A^c \\in \\mathscr S$.\n2. If $A \\in \\mathscr S$ and $B \\in \\mathscr S$ then $A \\cup B \\in \\mathscr S$.\n\nIf $\\mathscr S$ is an algebra of subsets of $S$ then\n\n1. $S \\in \\mathscr S$\n2. $\\emptyset \\in \\mathscr S$\nProof\n1. Since $\\mathscr S$ is nonempty, there exists $A \\in \\mathscr S$. Hence $A^c \\in \\mathscr S$ so $S = A \\cup A^c \\in \\mathscr S$.\n2. $\\emptyset = S^c \\in \\mathscr S$\n\nSuppose that $\\mathscr S$ is an algebra of subsets of $S$ and that $A_i \\in \\mathscr S$ for each $i$ in a finite index set $I$.\n\n1. $\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i \\in \\mathscr S$\n2. $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i \\in \\mathscr S$\nProof\n1. This follows by induction on the number of elements in $I$.\n2. Thie follows from (a) and DeMorgan's law. If $A_i \\in \\mathscr S$ for $i \\in I$ then $A_i^c \\in \\mathscr S$ for $i \\in I$. Therefore $\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i^c \\in \\mathscr S$ and hence $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} A_i = \\left(\\bigcup_{i \\in I} A_i^c\\right)^c \\in \\mathscr S$.\n\nThus it follows that an algebra of sets is closed under a finite number of set operations. That is, if we start with a finite number of sets in the algebra $\\mathscr S$, and build a ne",

All societies have some form of an incest taboo that forbids sexual relationships with certain people. This is variable from culture to culture. Several explanations have been preferred to explain the origins of incest taboos. One cites biological reasons. Non-human primates seem to have an instinctual aversion to having sex with near relatives, so perhaps the same happens for humans. Another biological reason is that the incest taboo was established to maintain biological diversity. This suggests that people understood the consequences of breeding with relatives.\n\nAnother theory suggests that familiarity breeds contempt, while yet another suggests that incest taboos were developed to ensure that alliances were made outside of the family. Whatever the case may be, there have been culturally approved violations of the incest taboo usually in royal families such as those in pre-contact Hawaii, ancient Peru and Egypt (Bonvillain 2010).\n\nExogamy stipulates that an individual must marry outside of a kin, residential, or other specified group. For instance, the Yanomami must marry outside of their residential village. Endogamy, on the other hand, stipulates that an individual must marry within a specified kinship categories or social group. The classic example of endogamy is the Indian caste system. Arranged marriages are quite common among human societies. With arranged marriages, family elders, usually the parents, choose spouses for their children. Arranged marriages promote political, social, and economic ties.\n\nSometimes within the practices outlined above, other rules that single out certain kin as ideal marriage partners are adhered to. Cross-cousin marriage unites cousins linked by parents of opposite sex (brother/sister) while parallel-cousin marriage unites the children of siblings of the same sex. The benefits of these types of marriages is that it helps to maintain the family lineage.\n\n9.04: Economic Aspects of Marriage\n\nMost marriages have some type of economic exchange associated with them. Only about 25% of marriages do not have an economic aspect (Ember and Ember 2011: 195).\n\nAnthropologists have identified the following practices:\n\nBridewealth or Bride price: In this practice goods are transferred from the groom’s family to bride’s family in compensation for losing the productive and reproductive services of one of their daughters.\n\nBride service: This entails the groom performing a service for the family of the bride. Bride service could take several months or even years to complete.\n\nDowry: Dowry generally is practiced in cultures where women’s roles are less valued then men. This practice requires the transfer of goods from the bride’s family to the groom to compensate for acceptance of the responsibility of her support. This is most common in pastoral ",

The river current pulls the kayak along. Pushing the oars back against the water can move the kayak forward in the water, but that only accounts for part of the velocity. The kayak’s motion is an example of classical addition of velocities. In classical physics, velocities add as vectors. The kayak’s velocity is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water and the water’s velocity relative to the riverbank.\n\nClassical Velocity Addition\n\nFor simplicity, we restrict our consideration of velocity addition to one-dimensional motion. Classically, velocities add like regular numbers in one-dimensional motion (Figure $1$). Suppose, for example, a girl is riding in a sled at a speed 1.0 m/s relative to an observer. She throws a snowball first forward, then backward at a speed of 1.5 m/s relative to the sled. We denote direction with plus and minus signs in one dimension; in this example, forward is positive. Let $v$ be the velocity of the sled relative to the Earth, $u$ the velocity of the snowball relative to the Earth-bound observer, and $u'$ the velocity of the snowball relative to the sled.\n\nCLASSICAL VELOCITY ADDITION\n\n$u = v + u'$\n\nThus, when the girl throws the snowball forward, $U = 1.0 \\, m/s + 1.5 \\, m/s = 2.5 \\, m/s$. It makes good intuitive sense that the snowball will head towards the Earth-bound observer faster, because it is thrown forward from a moving vehicle. When the girl throws the snowball backward, $u = 1.0 \\, m/s + (-1.5 \\, m/s) = -0.5 \\, m/s$. The minus sign means the snowball moves away from the Earth-bound observer.\n\nRelativistic Velocity Addition\n\nThe second postulate of relativity (verified by extensive experimental observation) says that classical velocity addition does not apply to light. Imagine a car traveling at night along a straight road, as in Figure $3$. If classical velocity addition applied to light, then the light from the car’s headlights would approach the observer on the sidewalk at a speed $u = v + c$. But we know that light will move away from the car at speed $c$ relative to the driver of the car, and light will move towards the observer on the sidewalk at speed $c$, too.\n\nRELATIVISTIC VELOCITY ADDITION\n\nEither light is an exception, or the classical velocity addition formula only works at low velocities. The latter is the case. The correct formula for one-dimensional relativistic velocity addition is\n\n$u = \\dfrac{v + u'}{1 + \\frac{vu'}{c^2}},$\n\nwhere $v$ is the relative velocity between two observers, $u$ is the velocity of an object relative to one observer, and $u'$ is the velocity relative to the other observer. (For ease of v",

                "source_content": "The mythology of the “record contract” with a major record label may have largely run its course, but it still plays a large role in shaping the industry. The myth of the record contract has both a positive and negative spin: the positive is that of the young artist finally “making it,” being recognized for her talent and launched into a career of fame and fortune; the negative spin is that of the “evil” record company squashing the fragile creativity of the artist through the deceptions and greed of the record contract, subjugating the artist to a life of servitude and dashed dreams. Like all myths, there are kernels of truth in both the negative and positive spins on the record contract.\n\nIn this chapter, I will summarize some of the most common and most important terms that govern record contracts, and some of the ways in which these terms have failed to achieve the intent of one or the other party to the contract. (Note that the use of the word “term” is often used it to describe the provisions of a contract generally, as in “What are the terms of your contract?”. However, sometimes the word “term” is also used to describe the duration of a contract (how long it lasts), such as in “How long is the term of your contract?”. So be sure not to confuse the two uses of the word, as they will used in both ways below.)\n\nNegotiated Contracts.\n\nThe most important concept to understand about record contracts is that they are negotiated agreements (contracts) between independent parties. With very few exceptions, the law places very few obligations on the terms of a record contract, so they may be freely negotiated in or out of the contract, or altered to reflect the agreement of the parties. Record contracts contain common terms that end up in nearly all instances, but that does not make them required or non-negotiable.\n\nBecause nearly everything in a record contract is negotiable, the different relative bargaining positions of the parties frequently determines the terms of the contract. The term “bargaining position” describes the strength of one party’s power to shape the contract relative to another’s. Typically, the record company has a stronger bargaining position than the artist, but that is sometimes not the case. Artist’s with proven track records or hot new singles may wield a great deal of bargaining power and be able to leverage that power to obtain contract terms that are more favorable to the artist than to the record company, and certainly more favorable to the artist than if they were unknown newcomers.\n\nThe best way to think about bargaining position is by considering who is in the better position to “walk,” that is to leave and say “thanks, but no thanks” (or perhaps expressed in saltier language) when the negotiations aren’t going their way. Young artists desperate to sign any record deal will often agree to just about anything and will rarely walk away from the table until they sign. Older, more experienced, artists come to the discus",

                "source_content": "Summary\n\nProperty crimes frequently result in serious loss and monetary harm to victims, and as a category, include serious offenses like burglary, theft, arson, trespass, and criminal mischief (vandalism). Property is broadly defined to include real property (land), personal property (both tangible and intangible property), and personal services.\n\nAlaska has abandoned the common law categorization of theft crimes (e.g., larceny, embezzlement, and false pretenses) and instead adopted a consolidated theft statute. Theft is now graded into four degrees, largely dependent on the property stolen or its value. Under Alaska’s consolidated theft statutes, theft may be committed in one of six ways. Theft is a specific intent crime. Normally, to commit the crime of theft, the perpetrator must obtain “property of another” with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Thus, borrowing property with the intent to return it later may not constitute theft under the general theft statute. A thief commits theft if they exercise unauthorized control over another person’s property (if they also have the intent to permanently deprive). For this reason, a person may be guilty of shoplifting even if they do not leave the store. The code also includes various theft-type offenses that have been separated under the code, including vehicle theft, forgery, and scheme to defraud. Each offense contains unique elements that separate it from general theft.\n\nBurglary, similar to arson, is a crime against habitation and is designed to protect property owners. At common law, burglary was limited to breaking and entering into another’s dwelling at nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein. Alaska has expanded this definition, but some aspects of the common law remain. Burglary always requires an unprivileged entry into a structure and an intent to commit a crime therein. The general burglary statute (second-degree burglary) is the unlawful entry into a building with the intent to commit a crime inside the building. Aggravated burglary (first-degree burglary) occurs when the defendant is armed with a weapon, breaks into a dwelling, or injures an occupant while inside. Aggravated burglary is a class B felony offense punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. General burglary is a lower-level felony (a class C felony).\n\nArson is the burning or damaging of property by fire. Alaska grades arson into three degrees. First-degree arson, the most serious, is the intentional setting of a fire or causing an explosion that places someone in danger of serious injury. This includes first-responders like firefighters or police officers. Criminal mischief, more commonly known as vandalism, is damaging, destroying, or interfering with another person’s property. Criminal Mischief may also include acts of terrorism if a person intentionally damages property by “widely dangerous means”, which means a difficult-to-confide force. All criminal mischief statutes require the",

To understand this, we need a working definition of force. Our intuitive definition of force—that is, a push or a pull—is a good place to start. We know that a push or pull has both magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity) and can vary considerably in each regard. For example, a cannon exerts a strong force on a cannonball that is launched into the air. In contrast, Earth exerts only a tiny downward pull on a flea. Our everyday experiences also give us a good idea of how multiple forces add. If two people push in different directions on a third person, as illustrated in Figure \\(1\\), we might expect the total force to be in the direction shown. Since force is a vector, it adds just like other vectors, as illustrated in Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1a}\\) for two ice skaters. Forces, like other vectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar head-to-tail method or by trigonometric methods. These ideas were developed in Two-Dimensional Kinematics.\n\nFigure \\(\\PageIndex{1b}\\) is our first example of a free-body diagram, which is a technique used to illustrate all the external forces acting on a body. The body is represented by a single isolated point (or free body), and only those forces acting on the body from the outside (external forces) are shown. (These forces are the only ones shown, because only external forces acting on the body affect its motion. We can ignore any internal forces within the body.) Free-body diagrams are very useful in analyzing forces acting on a system and are employed extensively in the study and application of Newton’s laws of motion.\n\nA more quantitative definition of force can be based on some standard force, just as distance is measured in units relative to a standard distance. One possibility is to stretch a spring a certain fixed distance, as illustrated in Figure \\(2\\), and use the force it exerts to pull itself back to its relaxed shape—called a restoring force—as a standard. The magnitude of all other forces can be stated as multiples of this standard unit of force. Many other possibilities exist for standard forces. (One that we will encounter in Magnetism is the magnetic force between two wires carrying electric current.) Some alternative definitions of force will be given later in this chapter.\n\nTAKE HOME EXPERIMENT: FORCE STANDARDS\n\nTo investigate force standards and cause and effect, get two identical rubber bands. Hang one rubber band vertically on a hook. Find a small household item that could be attached to the rubber band using a paper clip, and use this item as a weight to investigate the stretch of the rubber band. Measure the amount of stretch produced in the rubber band with one, two, and four of these (identical) items suspended from the rubber band. What is the relationship between th",

Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone’s piezoelectric properties that cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts, coupled together via paracrine cell signaling, are referred to as bone remodeling units. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair micro-damaged bones (from everyday stress), and to shape and sculpture the skeleton during growth.\n\nBone remodeling: Bone tissue is removed by osteoclasts, and then new bone tissue is formed by osteoblasts. Both processes utilize cytokine (TGF-β, IGF) signaling.\n\nBone volume is determined by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. The action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are controlled by a number of chemical factors that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells, controlling the rate at which bone is made, destroyed, or changed in shape. The cells also use paracrine signalling to control the activity of each other.\n\nRole of Growth Factors\n\nRecent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins.\n\n• Insulin-like growth factors protect cartilage cells, and are associated with the activation of osteocytes.\n• The transforming growth factor beta superfamily includes bone morphogenic proteins involved in osteogenesis.\n• Fibroblast growth factor activates various cells of the bone marrow including osteoclasts and osteoblasts.\n• Platelet-derived growth factor has been found to enhance bone collagen degradation.\n\nEvidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation.\n\nResearch has suggested that trabecular bone volume in postmenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.\n\nClinical Note\n\nOsteoporosis means porous bone, which is caused by an over-reaction to osteoclastic bone resorption, and makes bones quite fragile for the elderly. Falls are dangerous for the elderly because they are more likely to break a bone. Hip fractures are especiall",

NORMANDY SCHOOL DISTRICT, Respondent.\n\nAttorney(s) appearing for the Case\n\n[734 S.W.2d 944] Daniel J. Gralike, Paskal, Cohen & Benson, Clayton, for appellant. Darold E. Crotzer, Jr., Steinberg & Crotzer, Clayton, for respondent.\n\nKAROHL, Judge.\n\nJanis Smith appeals a judgment of the circuit court affirming the decision of the Board of Education of the Normandy School District (Board) to terminate her indefinite contract as a permanent teacher as that status is defined in Section 168.104(4) RSMo 1978. She was a teacher in the district for sixteen years. The Teacher Tenure Act provides substantive and procedural safeguards with respect to tenured teachers. The purpose of the Act is to establish strictly defined grounds and procedures for removing a permanent teacher which may not be evaded or other procedures substituted therefor. Iven v. Hazelwood School District, 710 S.W.2d 462, 464 (Mo.App.1986).\n\nOn June 26, 1985 the Board entered findings of fact, conclusions of law and ordered the indefinite contract of Janis Smith be terminated for cause. Within fifteen days of receipt of the order Smith filed a timely Notice of Appeal with the Board. Section 168.120.1 RSMo 1978. The Board promptly certified the record of its proceedings and filed the same in the circuit court for its review according to the provisions of Chapter 536 RSMo according to Section 168.120.2 RSMo 1978. The scope of review before the circuit court is defined in Section 536.140.1 RSMo 1978. We review the decision of the Board under Rule 73.01 as interpreted in Murphy v. Carron, 536 S.W.2d 30, 32 (Mo. banc 1976).\n\nAppellant teacher claims: (1) the Board failed to comply with the provisions of Section 168.116(2) RSMo 1978 which requires the Board to begin the termination proceeding by a “warning in writing, stating specifically the causes which, if not removed, may result in charges”; (2) the Board waived prior warnings by subsequently offering a continuing contract for the next school year; and, (3) the termination was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.\n\nWe discussed the chronological sequence of the requirements of Section 168.116 RSMo 1978 for termination of a tenured teacher in Iven v. Hazelwood School District, 710 S.W.2d 462, 464 (Mo. App.1986). We review the claims of error in the same sequence.\n\nAppellant teacher claims that the Board erred in its conclusion of law that letters from the Superintendent of schools addressed to Smith on April 22, 1983 and September 17, 1984 satisfied the statutory requirements for a “warning in writing.” The April 22, 1983 letter contains the following:\n\nThis letter is being sent to you pursuant to Section 168.116-2 RSMo. 1978.

Identify the effects of trade on prices and outputs using a PPF diagram.\n\nThe Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) theorem states that a country that is capital abundant will export the capital-intensive good. Likewise, the country that is labor abundant will export the labor-intensive good. Each country exports that good that it produces relatively better than the other country. In this model, a country’s advantage in production arises solely from its relative factor abundancy.\n\nThe H-O Theorem Graphical Depiction: Variable Proportions\n\nThe H-O model assumes that the two countries (United States and France) have identical technologies, meaning they have the same production functions available to produce steel and clothing. The model also assumes that the aggregate preferences are the same across countries. The only difference that exists between the two countries in the model is a difference in resource endowments. We assume that the United States has relatively more capital per worker in the aggregate than does France. This means that the United States is capital abundant compared to France. Similarly, France, by implication, has more workers per unit of capital in the aggregate and thus is labor abundant compared to the United States. We also assume that steel production is capital intensive and clothing production is labor intensive.\n\nThe difference in resource endowments is sufficient to generate different PPFs in the two countries such that equilibrium price ratios would differ in autarky. To see why, imagine first that the two countries are identical in every respect. This means they would have the same PPF (depicted as the blue $PPF_0$ in Figure $1$), the same set of aggregate indifference curves, and the same autarky equilibrium. Given the assumption about aggregate preferences—that is, $U = C_CC_S$—the indifference curve, $I$, will intersect the countries’ PPF at point $A$, where the absolute value of the slope of the tangent line (not drawn), $P_C/P_S$, is equal to the slope of the ray from the origin through point $A$. The slope is given by $\\frac{C_S^A}{C_C^A}$. In other words, the autarky price ratio in each country will be given by\n\n$\\left( \\frac{P_C}{P_S} \\right)_{Aut}^0 = \\frac{C_S^A}{C_C^A} \\nonumber .$\n\nNext, suppose that labor and capital are shifted between the two countries. Suppose labor is moved from the United States to France, while capital is moved from France to the United States. This will have two effects. First, the United States will now have more capital and less labor, and France will have more labor and less capital than it did initially. This implies that $K/L> K^*/L^*$, or that the United States is capital abundant and France is labor abundant. Second, the two countries’ PPFs will shift. To show how, we apply the Rybczynski theorem.\n\nThe United States experiences an increase in $K$ and a decrease in $L$. Both ch",

We have proceeded in a fashion that accentuated potential differences between these three schools of thought. However, now that the elements of all three approaches have been presented, we are in a position to explore how real and extensive these differences are. Is there one cognitive science, or many? One approach to answering this question is to consider whether the distinctions between the elements of the cognitive sciences are truly differences in kind.\n\nThe position of the current chapter is that there are strong relations amongst the three schools of thought in cognitive science; differences between these schools are more matters of degree than qualitative differences of kind. Let us set a context for this discussion by providing an argument similar in structure to the one framed by Adams and Aizawa (2008) against the notion of the extended mind.\n\nOne important critique of embodied cognitive science’s proposal of the extended mind is based on an analysis of the mark of the cognitive (Adams & Aizawa, 2008). The mark of the cognitive is a set of necessary and sufficient features that distinguish cognitive phenomena from other phenomena. Adams and Aizawa’s central argument against the extended mind is that it fails to provide the required features.\n\nIf one thinks that cognitive processing is simply any sort of dynamical system process, then—so understood—cognitive processing is again likely to be found spanning the brain, body and environment. But, so understood, cognitive processing will also be found in the swinging of a pendulum of a grandfather clock or the oscillations of the atoms of a hydrogen molecule. Being a dynamical system is pretty clearly insufficient for cognition or even a cognitive system. (Adams & Aizawa, 2008, p. 23)\n\nConnectionist and embodied approaches can easily be characterized as explicit reactions against the classical viewpoint. That is, they view certain characteristics of classical cognitive science as being incorrect, and they propose theories in which these characteristics have been removed. For instance, consider Rodney Brooks’ reaction against classical AI and robotics:\n\nDuring my earlier years as a postdoc at MIT, and as a junior faculty member at Stanford, I had developed a heuristic in carrying out research. I would look at how everyone else was tackling a certain problem and find the core central thing that they all agreed on so much that they never even talked about it. I would negate the central implicit belief and see where it led. This often turned out to be quite useful. (Brooks, 2002, p. 37)\n\nThis reactive approach suggests a context for the current chapter: that there should be a mark of the classical, a set of necessary and sufficient features that distinguish the theories of classical cognitive science from the theories of either connectionist or of embodied cognitive science.

Here are a number of those questions.\n\nIs it Current? Is it Local?\n\nCheck the timestamp: is this three years old? If so, is it still relevant? Be careful about a phenomenon called “Context Collapse”, coined by Danah Boyd: everything on the internet and particularly on social media seems to be taking place in *my context* *right now*. If you see an article being shared that says “Our area” for instance, look at the original source and original poster. Is it actually your area? Or is it a different area that only looks like your area because it is taken out of its original context and shifted to your own local context. If you see an article being shared that says “unemployment on the rise” for another instance, check the timestamp. Is it current? If it’s three years old, then unemployment might not be currently on the rise. Time is important to context as well.\n\nEverything we share online seems to be relevant here and now even though it often isn’t. We just have to do some digging to find out whether it is or not.\n\nSimilarly, if someone posted something about a cure being found to Coronavirus, but it was posted in 2018, then it’s not COVID-19 that they’re talking about! Or if the article is from March or 2020 and you’re in August of 2020, then that cure was probably not all it was cracked up to be since it isn’t widespread news many months later.\n\nWhat are others saying about it?\n\nAnother way of safeguarding against being duped by fake news or otherwise false information is to look at the same news story or piece of information from multiple independent sources. Are multiple world governments confirming the same bit of information? Are multiple news outlets with independent sources reporting the same story? Has the story or claim been debunked by other sources? Can we trust the sources doing the debunking? Have you checked independent fact-checkers like Snopes.com, factcheck.org, Politifact.org or the like? Have you looked to see what reporters from a variety of sources are saying about the story or piece of information (Twitter is probably a decent place to find this out)? Have you looked at sources from a variety of ideological backgrounds to find their takes on the story?\n\nIs it Plausible?\n\nWe can often independently assess whether something is plausible or not just using our “common sense” (I hate that phrase, but it’s somewhat applicable here). Is it plausible that Hillary Clinton is involved in a child-trafficking ring that has headquarters in your local pizza place? Not really. Is it plausible that Bill Gates has microchipping technology so advanced that it can fit in a vaccine needle—something that outstrips any nanotechnology known to exist? Is it plausible that he actually wants to microchip everyone? To what end? Put your skeptic’s hat on and consider whether t",

Define centripetal force. Can any type of force (for example, tension, gravitational force, friction, and so on) be a centripetal force? Can any combination of forces be a centripetal force?\n\n5. If centripetal force is directed toward the center, why do you feel that you are ‘thrown’ away from the center as a car goes around a curve? Explain.\n\n6. Race car drivers routinely cut corners as shown in Figure. Explain how this allows the curve to be taken at the greatest speed.\n\nTwo paths around a race track curve are shown. Race car drivers will take the inside path (called cutting the corner) whenever possible because it allows them to take the curve at the highest speed.\n\n7.

If the car goes over the top at just the right speed, gravity alone will supply the centripetal force. What other force acts and what is its direction if:\n\n(a) The car goes over the top at faster than this speed?\n\n(b)The car goes over the top at slower than this speed?\n\nAmusement rides with a vertical loop are an example of a form of curved motion.\n\n8.

Here, the actual group process effects decision-making. In Groupthink, the desire for group cohesion often becomes more important than making a quality decision. Instead of disagreeing and starting an argument with the other group members, a person will just go along with the group, so as not to be isolated and left out. This action is also referred to as the mismanagement of disagreement. Members disagree, but the need to be part of the group keeps them silent.\n\nA common Groupthink experience occurs in marriage. A spouse will experience Groupthink when he or she decides not to argue with a decision that is being discussed. They may disagree with the decision being made, but they decide that harmony within the marriage is more important than their disagreement with the decision. We often refer to this as not “rocking the boat.” In this situation spouses voluntarily give up conflicting views to preserve the family’s harmony and closeness.\n\nIn our professional lives, we will often be asked to be part of a group or organization that needs to make decisions. Group interaction can create additional challenges to effective decision-making as demonstrated in the 1986 decision to launch the Challenger space shuttle.\n\nAfter the embarrassment of several days of postponing the launch, NASA officials at Cape Canaveral decided to allow the Challenger to lift off. Just hours before the fateful launch, frigid temperatures, in the mid 20s, and dangerous wind gusts of 35 miles per hour had been recorded. Nevertheless, the signal to go ahead with the launch was initiated. All, seemed to go well at first. Shirley Green, the new public relations officer, remembered thinking, It is so beautiful. It seems so perfect.”\n\nUnfortunately, the flight was anything but perfect. Less than half a second after booster ignition, just as the shuttle began to lift off the pad, a white, then a black puff of smoke gushed from a joint between two segments of the shuttle’s right booster. Just slightly over a minute into the flight, as Shirley Green along with millions of Americans were watching, a huge fireball appeared where the shuttle had been. There was complete silence in the control room. For a moment, there was no sound. She gripped the shoulder of Chuck Hollingshead, the Kennedy Space Center’s veteran public affairs officer. He turned to face her. “Is it gone?” she asked. “Yes,” Hollingshead said, shaking his head, “It is gone.”\n\nWithin days a Presidential Commission was established to investigate the tragedy. Reports from this committee have suggested that the decision to launch the space shuttle was totally wrong. There appears to have been a growing anxiety among the launch crew. Past successes may have given the staff the impression that nothing could go wrong.\n\nImportant information, such as the booster project engineers protesting t",

You have had a tough go of it for the last 24 hours.”\n\n“Any information on my girlfriend?”\n\n“Sorry, I don’t know anything. I just came on. I would ask your Mom when she comes in.”\n\nLooking disappointed, Aaron nods.\n\n“I know this is tough. Let’s focus on you. Today will be a bit action-packed for you. Bloodwork today, probably in a couple of minutes. Then Physio is going to see you and get you up and about. Dr. Labinski will come in, and together we are going to change that dressing. If you can tolerate more than a few sips of water, we will see if I can get you something a little more like jello.”\n\n“Can I have a milkshake?”\n\n“Maybe later. Let’s see how the water goes down.” Jeremy pauses. “Now, if you’re up to it, I am going to give you the once over, listen to your chest, and check your dressing.”\n\n“Sure, whatever. The tube that is down there, you know…”\n\n“That’s called a foley catheter and it goes through your penis to your bladder. It drains your urine out and allows me to see if you are drinking enough or not. If things keep going well today and you are able to tolerate an increase in fluids, I’ll remove the catheter. Sound ok?”\n\nAaron leans back, closes his eyes and nods.\n\nJeremy efficiently completes his assessment and moves outside the room to record his findings.\n\nTime: 10h45\n\nJeremy feels a light touch on his shoulder and turns away from the computer where he is charting to see a very fit young man in street clothes. “Can I help you?”\n\n“Sorry to disturb you. My name is Chin and I’m the physiotherapist today. Just started here a couple of weeks ago.”\n\n“Oh, hi.” Jeremy looks down to see an ID tag dangling from Chin’s right front pocket.\n\n“I’m here to check on a patient from last night. Mr. Knoll?”\n\n“Yes, he’s one of my patients. Doing quite well and is probably ready to get out of bed and begin moving around.”\n\n“That’s excellent. Can you tell me more about him?”\n\n“Sure, come closer and I’ll pull his chart up on this computer and we’ll go through the history together.”\n\nTime: 11h00\n\n“Thank you, Jeremy, for walking me through the chart,” says Chin. “Are you able to assist me with mobilizing Aaron?”\n\n“Yes, let’s go see him and see if he wants to get up.”\n\nWalking into the room, they find Aaron and Mrs. Knoll talking.\n\n“Hi, Aaron, Mrs. Knoll. This is Chin. He’s a physiotherapist, and he’s going to help me get Aaron out of bed and learn how to move around with the large incision that he has.”\n\n“Do I have to leave?” Mrs. Knoll asks.\n\nChin shakes his head. “Definitely not.

(Public Domain; Ekta Parishad via Wikipedia). \n\n04: Gender and Work in the Global Economy \n\nWork is an arena in which gendered processes intersect with multiple social inequalities to influence what jobs people have, how they experience those jobs, and whether those jobs provide them with secure, fulfilling and upwardly mobile careers, or relegate them to insecure, dead-end, dangerous, or even degrading labor. In the US, hard work is supposed to lead to a whole host of social and material rewards (i.e., respect, power, a house, a car, a yacht). The context surrounding hard work, for instance whether that work is paid or unpaid, compensated at a minimum wage or six-figure salary, is gendered in deep and complex ways. As we mentioned previously, childcare is hard work that is often underpaid or not paid at all and is most often done by women. Furthermore, even if women do not perform most of this work themselves, certain career trajectories are forced on them, and they are placed in lower paying and less prestigious “mommy tracks” whether or not they choose this themselves. We can also see institutionalized labor inequalities at the global scale by looking at who cares for North American children when middle-class mothers take on full-time jobs and hire nannies, typically immigrant women from Eastern Europe and the Global South, to care for their children.\n\n4.02: Gender and Work in the US\n\nNow, more than ever, women in the US are participating in the labor force in full-time, year-round positions.[1] This was not always the case. Changes in the economy (namely, the decline of men’s wages), an increase in single-mothers, and education and job opportunities and cultural shifts created by feminist movement politics from the 1960s and 1970s have fueled the increase in women’s labor force participation. Dual-earner homes are much more common than the breadwinner-homemaker model popularized in the 1950s, in which women stayed home and did unpaid labor (such as laundry, cooking, childcare, cleaning) while men participated in the paid labor force in jobs that would earn them enough money to support a spouse and children. It turns out this popular American fantasy, often spoken of in political “family values” rhetoric, was only ever a reality for some white, middle-class people, and, for most contemporary households, is now completely out of reach.\n\nThough men and women are participating in the labor force, higher education, and paid work in near-equal numbers, a wage gap between men and women workers remains. On average, women workers make 77% of what men make. This gap persists even when controlling for educational differences, full-time work versus part-time work, and year-round versus seasonal occupational statuses. Thus, women with similar educational backgrounds who work the same number of hours per year as their male counterparts are making 23% less than similarly situated men. So, how can t",

When confronted with a collection of data they do not understand, scientists try to organize the data by searching for patterns or trends that can give clues about the physical processes that affect the data.\n\nIn this activity you will analyze images of 16 nearby galaxies taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. You will attempt to organize them according to their shapes, colors, and one more characteristic of your choosing.\n\nPlay Activity\n\nA.

Comparing categories\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nThe structure or morphology of galaxies can be categorized as being either spiral, elliptical, or irregular. You might have chosen to use those terms or something similar in the previous activity. Edwin Hubble was the first person to classify galaxies in much the same manner. He noticed a correlation when comparing galaxy morphology and color. A correlation does not necessarily imply that one thing caused the other, but it does hint that the two properties are related. Elliptical galaxies tend to be red, while spirals and irregular galaxies tend to have more blue stars. Hubble developed a detailed morphological classification scheme known as the Hubble tuning-fork diagram shown in Figure 14.16.\n\nThese three broad categories can be further subdivided based on visual appearance. Hubble noticed that some spiral galaxies have a bright line, or bar, running through them. He called them barred spiral galaxies. Those without bars he simply denoted as spiral galaxies. Spiral galaxies are further classified by how tightly their arms are wound and the brightness of the central bulge. Elliptical galaxies are classified by how round or elliptical they appear.

It should not be a secret that each of these forces plays some role in policy formation. Marion & Oliver, (2006; 2012) assert that the formulation of policy is influenced by social, political, economic, legal and ideological factors. The reader should pay close attention to these criteria in preparation for future evaluations. According to Marion & Oliver (2006: 2012) “The end result is crime policy that is rarely about reducing crime but policy that plays well with the public and the media” (p.23). None the less formulation of policy is the choice of those in charge either by position or authority, may be the inclination of fear mongering rather than factual contextual reporting.\n\nSocial influence may be derived through polls, financial support (politician’s life blood), lobbying groups, and advocates that not only provide rhetoric for the argument but also for financial support and is taken seriously in the creation of policy. Political influence regarding crime comes down to who would vote against a crime bill, but also the personal ideology of the politician plays a role in policy development (conservative or liberal point of view). Furthermore it is critical that the politician exhibits to the constituent that he or she is listening to their concerns. The government official that is at the bidding of the public listens to those that financially support her/him. The economic influence may create a false sense of complacency on two fronts.\n\nFirst, how is the policy implemented by the bureaucracy delegated for implementation? That is the governmental entity charged to fully implement public policy may be at odds with the policy itself. Especially if a new administration wishes to use the funding stream to satisfy the new agenda and as long as it remains in the spirt of law then it is generally accepted. The second issue is the funding stream may be elusive, ambiguous, and can again be diverted or reduced.\n\nAn example is the COPS program partially funding police officers for three years and then the municipality must begin to pay for the officer. The concept is flawed in that most municipalities do not have funding mechanisms to pay for the additional officers and the strings attached by the COPS Office could make it difficult for a municipality to enter into the program. An organization or municipality that is financially troubled to begin with (generally the areas in most need of additional officers), may apply under an exception that would normally require a portion of funding for the officers up front, and the exception could waive the upfront contribution. Ethically, a law enforcement administrator should bring to the attention of the COPS Office that the municipality does not expect a significant financial improvement at the conclusion of the grant period.

Take, for example, ‘development’ – a word that has the power to dictate national and international policies and attract or divert vast sums of money. This can be seen through the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals and their successors, the Sustainable Development Goals. These involve targets that every country in the world agreed to strive towards and to fund. They are based on an understanding of development that sees many countries in the Global South as not having yet achieved the economic progress of the North.\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest contributions of Latin American scholars to IR theory is dependency theory, which challenges dominant understandings of development as an organising principle in international politics. Dependency theory asserts that underdevelopment and poverty are the result of political, economic and cultural influences exerted on such countries from the outside. It presents the relationship between the Global South and the Global North as exploitative and unfair by underlining the ways in which states in the South have been incorporated into the world economic system through capitalist development, which has exploited human and material resources and disrupted indigenous modes of production. Dependency theory analyses the way in which the underdevelopment of many states in the South might be a direct result of the policies, interventions and unfair trading practices of states from the North. From this perspective, the current (unfair) economic relations between the Global North and South will not help the South to develop at all. Rather, they will keep the South poorer than the North. Rather than the need for states in the Global South to ‘develop’, dependency theory stresses that nothing short of a restructuring of the entire international economic system will deliver economic justice for the world’s poor.\n\nBuilding on the likes of dependency theory, scholars have demonstrated that the economic exploitation of many colonised nations did not stop with decolonisation. In fact, in the final years of colonialism – at the time when independence movements were becoming too strong to suppress – the departing colonial powers instigated a number of policies and programmes that paved the way for a new type of domination of Global South economies. The legacy of such policies was an emphasis on the production of cash crops for export, dependence on foreign financial interventions and the entrenchment of private capital (both domestic and foreign) as the engine of growth and development. North–South trade agreements and the policies of international organisations such as the World Trade Organization have further served to protect the interests of established powers despite repeated calls from the South for a fairer deal in global trade relations. They have served to privilege ‘developed’ state",

This assessment is the point of departure for any strategy. It becomes the mark from which any progress is measured, the principal from which any return is calculated. It can determine your practical or realistic goals and the strategies to achieve them. Eventually, the current situation becomes a time forgotten with the pride of success, or remembered with the regret of failure.\n\nUnderstanding the current situation is not just a matter of measuring it, but also of putting it in perspective and in context, relative to your own past performance and future goals, and relative to the realities of the economic world around you. Tools for understanding your current situation are your accounting and financial statements.\n\n3.1 ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nLearning Objectives\n1. Distinguish between accrual and cash accounting.\n2. Compare and contrast the three common financial statements.\n3. Identify the results shown on the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\n4. Explain the calculation and meaning of net worth.\n5. Trace how a bankruptcy can occur.\n\nClay tablets interested Sumerian traders because the records gave them a way to see their financial situation and to use that insight to measure progress and plan for the future. The method of accounting universally used in business today is known as accrual accounting. In this system events are accounted for even if cash does not change hands. That is, transactions are recorded at the time they occur rather than when payment is actually made or received. Anticipated or preceding payments and receipts (cash flows) are recorded as accrued or deferred. Accrual accounting is the opposite of cash accounting, in which transactions are recognized only when cash is exchanged.\n\nAccrual accounting defines earning as an economic event signified by an exchange of goods rather than by an exchange of cash. In this way, accrual accounting allows for the separation in time of the exchange of goods and the exchange of cash. A transaction can be completed over time and distance, which allows for extended—and extensive—trade. Another advantage of accrual accounting is that it gives a business a more accurate picture of its present situation.\n\nIn personal finance, it almost always makes more sense to use cash accounting, to define and account for events when the cash changes hands. As a result, incomes and expenses are noted when the cash is received or paid, or when the cash flows.\n\nThe Accounting Process\n\nFinancial decisions result in transactions, actual trades that buy or sell, invest or borrow. In the market economy, something is given up in order to get something, so each trade involves at least one thing given up and one thing gotten—two things flowing in at least two ",

                "source_content": "While many students first entering a sociology classroom are accustomed to conflating the terms “race,” “ethnicity,” and “minority group,” these three terms have distinct meanings for sociologists. The idea of race refers to superficial physical differences that a particular society considers significant, while ethnicity describes shared culture. And the term \"minority groups\" describe groups that are subordinate, or that lack power in society regardless of skin color or country of origin. For example, in modern U.S. history, the elderly might be considered a minority group due to a diminished status that results from popular prejudice and discrimination against them. Ten percent of nursing home staff admitted to physically abusing an elderly person in the past year, and 40 percent admitted to committing psychological abuse (World Health Organization 2011). In this chapter we focus on racial and ethnic minorities.\n\nWhat Is Race?\n\nHistorically, the concept of race has changed across cultures and eras, and has eventually become less connected with ancestral and familial ties, and more concerned with superficial physical characteristics. In the past, theorists have posited categories of race based on various geographic regions, ethnicities, skin colors, and more. Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions (Mongolia and the Caucus Mountains, for instance) or skin tones (black, white, yellow, and red, for example).\n\nSocial science organizations including the American Association of Anthropologists, the American Sociological Association, and the American Psychological Association have all taken an official position rejecting the biological explanations of race. Over time, the typology of race that developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse, and the social construction of race is a more sociological way of understanding racial categories. Research in this school of thought suggests that race is not biologically identifiable and that previous racial categories were arbitrarily assigned, based on pseudoscience, and used to justify racist practices (Omi and Winant 1994; Graves 2003). When considering skin color, for example, the social construction of race perspective recognizes that the relative darkness or fairness of skin is an evolutionary adaptation to the available sunlight in different regions of the world. Contemporary conceptions of race, therefore, which tend to be based on socioeconomic assumptions, illuminate how far removed modern understanding of race is from biological qualities. In modern society, some people who consider themselves “white” actually have more melanin (a pigment that determines skin color) in their skin than other people who identify as ”black.” Consider the case of the actress Rashida Jones. She is the daughter of a black man (Quincy Jones), and her best-known roles include Ann Perkins on Parks and Recreation, Karen Filippelli on The Office, and Zooey Rice inI Love You Man, none of whom are black",

Inventory is kept to co-ordinate production and shipping, to guard against variation in demand, and to guard against variation in production. The latter could be due to variation in supplier shipping times, variation in production times, production downtimes and any other cause that makes the completion of production on time uncertain.\n\nA very important idea is that the target inventory level needed to achieve a specified service level is a function of the variance in the process that adds items to the inventory, production, as well as the process the removes items from the inventory, customer demand. If there is no variation in these processes, then there is no need for inventory. Furthermore, the less the variation, the less inventory is needed. Variation could be random, such as the number of units demanded per day by customers, or structural: product A is produced on Monday and Wednesday and product B is produced on Tuesday and Thursday but there is customer demand for each product each day.\n\nWe will confine our discussion to the following situation of interest. Product is shipped to the customer early in the morning from inventory and is replaced by a production run during the day. Note that if the production run completes before the next shipment time, production can be considered to be instantaneous. In other words, as long as the production run is completed before the next shipment, how long before is not relevant.\n\nSuppose demand is constant and production is completely reliable. If demand is 100 units per day, then 100 units reside in the inventory until a shipment is made. Then the inventory is zero. The production run is for 100 units, which are placed in the inventory upon completion. This cycle is completed every day.\n\nThe following discussion considers how to establish the target inventory level to meet a pre-established service level when demand is random, when production is unreliable, and when both are true.\n\n9.3.1 Random Demand - Normally Distributed\n\nIn lean manufacturing, a buffer inventory is established to protect against random variation in customer demand. Suppose daily demand is normally distributed with a mean of $\\ \\mu$ units and a standard deviation of $\\ \\sigma$ units. Production capacity is such that the inventory can be reliably replaced each day. Management specifies a service level of SL.\n\nConsider equation 9-8,\n\n\\begin{align}P(X \\leq x) \\leq S L\\tag{9-8}\\end{align}\n\nThis equation says that the probability that the random variable, X, daily demand, is less than the target inventory, the constant x, must be SL. Solving for the target inventory, x, yields equation 9-9.\n\n\\begin{align}x=\\mu+\\sigma^{*} z_{S L}\\tag{9-9}\\end{align}\n\nExercise\n\nCustomer demand is normally distributed with a mean of 100 units per day and a standard deviation of 10 units.

It turns out that any motion of an air parcel is a combination of five different motions, one being translation, which we have already discussed, and four of which can be represented by pairs of partial derivatives of velocity. Of these four, one is a deformation of the air parcel, called stretching, which flattens and lengthens the air parcel. A second is another deformation of the air parcel, called shearing, which twists the air parcel in both the x and y directions. A third is pure rotation, called vorticity. A fourth enlarges or shrinks the parcel without changing its shape, called divergence. Let’s consider each of five types of air motion alone, even though more than one is often occurring for an air parcel.\n\nTranslation simply moves the air parcel without stretching it, shearing it, rotating, or changing its area. There are no partial derivatives of velocities involved with translation.\n\nFor the remaining four cases, we will provide examples in which the motion (stretching, shearing, vorticity, and divergence) has a positive value. We could have provided examples in which the motion has negative value, but the conclusions would be the same.\n\nStretching deformation is represented by $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}-\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$,\n\nu gets more positive as xgets more positive and u gets more negative as x gets more negative (so that the derivative is always positive), making the parcel grow in the x direction. In the other direction, v gets more negative as y gets more positive and v gets more positive as y gets more negative (so that the derivative is always negative), making the parcel shrink in the y direction (see figure below). However, the total area of the air parcel will remain the same if $\\partial u / \\partial x=\\partial v / \\partial y$. Shown in the figure is positive stretching deformation; negative stretching deformation occurs when the parcel is stretched in the y direction.\n\nCredit: W. Brune\n\nShearing deformation is represented by $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. In this case, v gets more positive as x gets more positive and v gets more negative as x gets more negative, resulting in the air parcel part at lower x getting pushed towards lower y, and the air parcel part at higher x getting pushed towards higher y. At the same time, u gets more positive as y gets more positive and u gets more negative as y gets more negative, resulting in the air parcel part at lower ygetting pushed to lower x and the air parcel part at higher y getting pushed to higher x (see figure below). The total area of the air parcel remains the same after the shearing occurs. Shearing deformation is positive when the air parcel stretches in the southwest/northeast direction and contracts in the southeast/northwest direction (as in the figure below).

After four years, Mark finished college and opened Supreme Cleaners. During his first month of operations, Mark purchased dry-cleaning equipment and supplies. He also hired an employee, opened a savings account, and provided services to his first customers, among other things.\n\nMark kept thorough records of all of the daily business transactions for the month. At the end of the month, Mark reviewed his trial balance and realized that some of the information was not up to date. His equipment and supplies had been used, making them less valuable. He had not yet paid his employee for work completed. His business savings account earned interest. Some of his customers had paid in advance for their dry cleaning, with Mark's business providing the service during the month.\n\nWhat should Mark do with all of these events? Does he have a responsibility to record these transactions? If so, how would he go about recording this information? How does it affect his financial statements? Mark will have to explore his accounting process to determine if these end-of-period transactions require recording and adjust his financial statements accordingly. This exploration is performed by taking the next few steps in the accounting cycle.\n\n4.01: Explain the Concepts and Guidelines Affecting Adjusting Entries\n\nAnalyzing and Recording Transactions was the first of three consecutive chapters covering the steps in the accounting cycle (Figure 4.2).\n\nIn Analyzing and Recording Transactions, we discussed the first four steps in the accounting cycle: identify and analyze transactions, record transactions to a journal, post journal information to the general ledger, and prepare an (unadjusted) trial balance. This chapter examines the next three steps in the cycle: record adjusting entries (journalizing and posting), prepare an adjusted trial balance, and prepare the financial statements (Figure 4.3).\n\nAs we progress through these steps, you learn why the trial balance in this phase of the accounting cycle is referred to as an “adjusted” trial balance. We also discuss the purpose of adjusting entries and the accounting concepts supporting their need. One of the first concepts we discuss is accrual accounting.\n\nAccrual Accounting\n\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. Also, companies, public or private, using US GAAP or IFRS prepare their financial statements using the rules of accrual accounting.

                "source_content": "In the tenth century CE, a grand Persian sultan, Sultan Ali ibn Sulaiman al-Shirazi sailed to Kilwa Kisiwani, an island off the East African coast. When he arrived, he was generous and people liked him, which enabled him to marry the daughter of Mrimba, the local headman. The newlyweds were set up to live more or less happily ever after. However, Sultan Ali and Mrimba made a deal, brokered by Mrimba’s daughter. The deal gave Sultan Ali control of the island in exchange for enough cloth for Mrimba to “walk on it from the island to his new abode on the mainland.”15 The deal went through and Mrimba moved to the mainland, but then Mrimba regretted relinguishing his position and plotted to militarily retake the island from his son-in-law. In response, Sultan Ali used magic from the Qur’an to stop Mrimba’s plot. By reading the Qur’an in a special way, Sultan Ali kept the sea levels high, which confined Mrimba to the mainland, where he gave up and retired. Upon Mrimba’s death, his mainland territory passed to the son of Sultan Ali who also ruled Kilwa Kisiwani. In this oral tradition, the union of Mrimba’s daughter and Sultan Ali forged a new Muslim family, with Persian and African ancestry, that ruled Kilwa Kisiwani and the mainland coast.\n\nThe above version is just one account of Kilwa Kisiwani’s origins; nevertheless, it conveys some very important elements of Swahili identity. Starting at least by the thirteenth century CE, in response to resident Arab merchants who scorned non-Muslims and some African practices, African elites in East Africa claimed descent from Shirazis (Persians) and to have been early converts to Islam. In some cases, the connections may have been exaggerated or inaccurate from a historical standpoint. However, regardless of their accuracy, these stories demonstrate some of the defining features of Swahili identity.\n\nAs it controlled gold coming from Great Zimbabwe, Kilwa Kisiwani became one of the most prosperous of the Swahili city-states. From 1000 to 1500 CE, Swahili city-states were wealthy urban areas connected both to the African interior and the larger Indian Ocean World. Dozens of Swahili city-states running down the East African coast from Mogadishu to Sofala, and including islands off the coast, were commercial centers, tied together by a shared identity, not an overarching political structure. In addition to Islam and claims to Persian ancestry, Swahili identity also became associated with Indian Ocean trade, an urban style, and a shared language (Swahili).\n\nHistorians of Africa trace the origins of the Swahili city-states to the Bantu expansions, explaining that by the first century CE, Bantu farmers had built communities along the East African coast. They traded with southern Arabia, southeast Asia, and occasionally Greece and Rome. Although trade contracted after the fall of the Roman Empire, it rebounded several hundred years later. At that time, residents of the Swahili city-states played a pivotal role as middl",

                "source_content": "This chapter extended the finite-state Markov chain results of Chapter 3 to the case of countably-infinite state spaces. It also provided an excellent example of how renewal pro­cesses can be used for understanding other kinds of processes. In Section 5.1, the first-passage-time random variables were used to construct renewal processes with renewals on successive transitions to a given state. These renewal processes were used to rederive the basic properties of Markov chains using renewal theory as opposed to the algebraic PerronFrobenius approach of Chapter 3. The central result of this was Theorem 5.1.4, which showed that, for an irreducible chain, the states are positive-recurrent if and only if the steady-state equations, (5.18), have a solution. Also if \\ref{5.18} has a solution, it is positive and unique. We also showed that these steady-state probabilities are, with probability 1, time-averages for sample paths, and that, for an ergodic chain, they are limiting probabilities independent of the starting state.\n\nWe found that the major complications that result from countable state spaces are, first, different kinds of transient behavior, and second, the possibility of null-recurrent states. For finite-state Markov chains, a state is transient only if it can reach some other state from which it can’t return. For countably infinite chains, there is also the case, as in Figure 5.2 for $p>1 / 2$, where the state just wanders away, never to return. Null recurrence is a limiting situation where the state wanders away and returns with probability 1, but with an infinite expected time. There is not much engineering significance to null recurrence; it is highly sensitive to modeling details over the entire infinite set of states. One usually uses countably infinite chains to simplify models; for example, if a buffer is very large and we don’t expect it to overflow, we assume it is infinite. Finding out, then, that the chain is transient or null-recurrent simply means that the modeling assumption is not very good.\n\nWe next studied birth-death Markov chains and reversibility. Birth-death chains are widely used in queueing theory as sample time approximations for systems with Poisson arrivals and various generalizations of exponentially distributed service times. Equation \\ref{5.28} gives their steady-state probabilities if positive-recurrent, and shows the conditions under which they are positive-recurrent. We showed that these chains are reversible if they are positiverecurrent.\n\nTheorems 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 provides a simple way to find the steady-state distribution of reversible chains and also of chains where the backward chain behavior could be hypothesized or deduced. We used reversibility to show that M/M/1 and M/M/m Markov chains satisfy Burke’s theorem for sampled-time — namely that the departure process is Bernoulli, and that the state at any time is independent of departures before that time.\n\nBranching processes were introduced in Section 5.5 ",

                "source_content": "Sellers in oligopolies can limit competition by driving out competitors, blocking entry by new competitors, or cooperating with other sellers with market power to keep prices higher than would be the case in a market with strong price competition. In order for sellers to exercise market power, either the market will have fairly few selling firms or there will be some selling firms that account for a large portion of all the market sales. When this happens, the market is said to have high seller concentration. Although high seller concentration in itself is not sufficient for exercise of seller power, it is generally a necessary condition and constitutes a potential for the exercise of seller power in the future. In this section, we will consider two numerical measures of market concentration: concentration ratios and the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI).\n\nBoth measures of seller concentration are based on seller market shares. A firm’s market share is the percentage of all market sales that are purchased from that firm. The highest possible market share is 100%, which is the market share of a monopolist. Market shares may be based either on the number of units sold or in terms of monetary value of sales. The latter use of monetary value is convenient when there are variations in the good or service sold and different prices are charged.\n\nConcentration ratios are the result of sorting all sellers on the basis of market share, selecting a specified number of the firms with the highest market shares, and adding the market shares for those firms. For example, the concentration ratio CR4 is the sum of the market shares for the four largest firms in terms of volume in a market and CR8 is the sum of the eight largest firms in terms of volume. The U.S. Census Bureau periodically publishes concentration ratios for different industries in the United States.See U.S. Census Bureau (2010).\n\nSuppose a market has 10 sellers with market shares (ranked from high to low) of 18%, 17%, 15%, 13%, 12%, 8%, 7%, 5%, 3%, and 2%. The CR4 ratio for this market would be 63 (18 + 17 + 15 + 13), and the CR8 ratio would be 95 (18 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 12 + 8 + 7 + 5).\n\nAlthough concentration ratios are easy to calculate and easily understood, there are two shortcomings. First, the number of firms in the ratio is arbitrary. There is no reason that a four-firm concentration ratio indicates concentration potential any better than a three-firm or five-firm concentration ratio. Second, the ratio does not indicate whether there are one or two very large firms that clearly dominate all other firms in market share or the market shares for the firms included in the concentration ratio are about the same.\n\nAn alternative concentration measure that avoids these problems is the HHI. This index is computed by taking the market shares of all firms in the market, squaring the individual market shares, and finally summing them. The squaring has the effect of amplifying the larger market shares. T",

                "source_content": "Back in section 13.1 (p. 124), we learned how to write simple queries to selectively match only certain elements of a Series. The same technique is available to us with DataFrames, only it’s more powerful since there are more columns to work with at a time.\n\nLet’s return to the Simpsons example from p. 174, which is reproduced here:\n\n| species age gender fave IQ hair salary\n\n| name\n\n| Homer human 36 M beer 74.0 none 52000.0\n\n| Marge human 34 F helping others 120.0 stacked tall 0.0\n\n| Bart human 10 M skateboard 90.0 buzz 0.0\n\n| Lisa human 8 F saxophone 200.0 curly 0.0\n\n| Maggie human 1 F pacifier 100.0 curly 0.0\n\n| SLH dog 4 M NaN 100.0 shaggy 0.0\n\nWe can filter this on certain rows by including a query in boxies:\n\nCode \\(1\\) (Python):\n\nadults = simpsons[simpsons.age > 18]\n\n| species age gender fave IQ hair salary\n\n| name\n\n| Homer human 36 M beer 74.0 none 52000.0\n\n| Marge human 34 F helping others 120.0 stacked tall 0.0\n\nAs with Serieses, we can’t forget to repeat the name of the variable (“simpsons”) before giving the query criteria (“> 18”). Unlike with Serieses, we also specify a column name (“.age”) that we want to query.\n\nWe can also provide compound conditions in just the same way as before (section 13.1, p. 128). If we want only human children, we say:\n\nCode \\(2\\) (Python):\n\nkids = simpsons[(simpsons.age <= 18) & (simpsons.species == \"human\")]\n\n| species age gender fave IQ hair salary\n\n| name\n\n| Bart human 10 M skateboard 90.0 buzz 0.0\n\n| Lisa human 8 F saxophone 200.0 curly 0.0\n\n| Maggie human 1 F pacifier 100.0 curly 0.0\n\nwhereas if we want everybody who’s smart and/or old, we say:\n\nCode \\(3\\) (Python):\n\nold_andor_wise = simpsons[(simpsons.IQ > 100) | (simpsons.age > 30)]\n\n| species age gender fave IQ hair salary\n\n| name\n\n| Homer human 36 M beer 74.0 none 52000.0\n\n| Marge human 34 F helping others 120.0 stacked tall 0.0\n\n| Lisa human 8 F saxophone 200.0 curly 0.0\n\nTo narrow it down to only specific columns, we can combine our query with the syntax from section 17.1 (p. 177). You see, our query gave us another (shorter) DataFrame as a result, which has the same rights and privileges as any other DataFrame. So tacking on another pair of boxies gives us just a column:\n\nCode \\(4\\) (Python):\n\nprint(simpsons[simpsons.age > 18]['fave'])\n\n| name\n\n| Homer beer\n\n| Marge helping others\n\n| Name: fave, dtype: object\n\nwhile tacking on double boxies gives us columns:\n\nCode \\(5\\) (Python):\n\nprint(simpsons[simpsons.age > 18])\n\n| fave gender IQ\n\n| name\n\n| Homer beer M 74.0\n\n| Marge helping others F 120.0\n\nNote that in the first of these cases, we got a Series back, whereas in the second (with the double boxies) we got a DataFrame with multiple columns. Combining all these operations takes practice, but lets you slice and dice a DataFrame up in innumerable different ways.\n\n18.02: Section 2-\n\nOne of the most useful methods in the whole DataFrame repertoire is .groupby().

Ocean surface currents organize into Gyres that are characterized by circulation at the scale of the ocean basin. The figure below shows the basic pattern. Note that gyres circulate clockwise in the northern Hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nSource: UCAR\n\nThe influence of the Coriolis effect on ocean currents increases with increasing latitude, so the equatorial currents are similar in each ocean basin, although their flow direction (east to west) is consistent with the sense of flow in the large-scale gyres within each ocean basin. But the variation of Coriolis forcing as a function of latitude has a pronounced affect on surface currents. The poleward currents on the Western side of each ocean basin are distinctly different from those on the Eastern side of the ocean basin.\n\nWestern Boundary Currents are swift, narrow and deep relative to Eastern Boundary Currents, which are slower, broader and shallower than WBC's. Western Boundary Currents tend to carry heat from the equator poleward, so think back to where we started in this Lesson; everything is driven by differential solar heating. The excess heat received in the equatorial regions drives everything, including the strong Western Boundary Currents such as the familiar Gulf Stream and the East Australian Current (from Finding Nemo fame).\n\nThe figure below shows surface current information for the North Atlantic. The color scale is flow velocity in m/s, and the arrow along the bottom shows a 1 m/s scale bar (vector). Note the narrowness of the Gulf Stream.\n\nSource: NOAA\n\nActivity 3\n\nLet's make our own maps and use them to calculate some things about heat transport. For this activity we will use ESR (Earth and Space Research) out of Seattle, WA. They have great research projects like OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-Time) which suites our purposes nicely. Let's visit them HERE(link is external). There's some good background information about OSCAR there, but we will be using the link \"OSCAR on SOTO\", with SOTO standing for \"State of the Ocean\". Once you click on \"OSCAR on SOTO\", you will open up a really cool interactive map. I encourage you to play around with it for a bit to see what kind of data it is capable of conveying (we could have used this for our density calculations for Activity 2!) Once you're done playing, check out \"Ocean Current Speed\", but then settle on \"Ocean Current Vectors\".\n\n->Note: This web site is mostly gone. Some of it is available here: https://www.esr.org/research/oscar/overview/(link is external)\n\n1.

Recognize organizational culture signs.\n\nHow Are Cultures Created?\n\nWhere do cultures come from? Understanding this question is important in understanding how they can be changed. An organization’s culture is shaped as the organization faces external and internal challenges and learns how to deal with them. When the organization’s way of doing business provides a successful adaptation to environmental challenges and ensures success, those values are retained. These values and ways of doing business are taught to new members as the way to do business (Schein, 1992).\n\nThe factors that are most important in the creation of an organization’s culture include founders’ values, preferences, and industry demands.\n\nFounder Values\n\nA company’s culture, particularly during its early years, is inevitably tied to the personality, background, and values of its founder or founders, as well as their vision for the future of the organization. When entrepreneurs establish their own businesses, the way they want to do business determines the organization’s rules, the structure set up in the company, and the people they hire to work with them. For example, some of the existing corporate values of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Holdings Inc. can easily be traced to the personalities of its founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. In 1978, the two high school friends opened up their first ice-cream shop in a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vermont. Their strong social convictions led them to buy only from the local farmers and devote a certain percentage of their profits to charities. The core values they instilled in their business can still be observed in the current company’s devotion to social activism and sustainability, its continuous contributions to charities, use of environmentally friendly materials, and dedication to creating jobs in low-income areas. Even though Unilever acquired the company in 2000, the social activism component remains unchanged and Unilever has expressed its commitment to maintaining it (Kiger, 2005; Rubis, et. al., 2005; Smalley, 2007).\n\nFounder values become part of the corporate culture to the degree to which they help the company be successful. For example, the social activism of Ben and Jerry’s was instilled in the company because the founders strongly believed in these issues. However, these values probably would not be surviving 3 decades later if they had not helped the company in its initial stages. In the case of Ben and Jerry’s, these values helped distinguish their brand from larger corporate brands and attracted a loyal customer base. Thus, by providing a competitive advantage, these values were retained as part of the corporate culture and were taught to new members as the right way to do business.\n\nIndustry Demands\n\nWhile founders undoubtedly exert a powerful influence over corporate cultures, the industr",

The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated with a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher prices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves determines the equilibrium price and quantity.\n\n3.2 Macroeconomics\n\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation, unemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation. Unemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic product is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\n\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\n\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a trough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also known as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\n\n3.4 Interest Rates\n\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of interest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a risk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\n\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\n\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase more of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a currency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have depreciated.\n\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\n\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800s, a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure \\(1\\)).\n\nBased on his observations, here is what Thomson proposed and why: The particles are attracted by positive (+) charges and repelled by negative (−) charges, so they must be negatively charged (like charges repel and unlike charges attract); they are less massive than atoms and indistinguishable, regardless of the source material, so they must be fundamental, subatomic constituents of all atoms. Although controversial at the time, Thomson’s idea was gradually accepted, and his cathode ray particle is what we now call an electron, a negatively charged, subatomic particle with a mass more than one thousand-times less that of an atom. The term “electron” was coined in 1891 by Irish physicist George Stoney, from “electric ion.”\n\nLink to Learning\n\nClick here to hear Thomson describe his discovery in his own voice.\n\nIn 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his “oil drop” experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops (Figure \\(2\\)).\n\nLooking at the charge data that Millikan gat",

These include global temperature, mean sea level, and oxygen (\\(O_{2}\\)), methane (\\(CH_{4}\\)), nitrous oxide (\\(N_{2}O\\)), and carbon dioxide (\\(CO_{2}\\)) levels. Each of the graphs allows you to zoom in enabling you to look at it more closely and zoom out showing changes back through several major ice ages – the last 800 thousand years.\n\nThe temperature graph on the dashboard shows the difference between the global average annual temperature for any one year and the global average for the 1850s, often regarded as the start of the industrial revolution. This difference is referred to as a temperature anomaly and is displayed for the past millennia on the default graph. The graph can be expanded to show temperature variation over the past 800,000 years.\n\nThe other environmental factor shown in the dashboard is global mean sea level. Since we will only be dealing with the temperature graph in this activity set, an explanation of what mean sea level is, how it is measured, and its impacts will appear in a later activity in this manual, Activity 16, Sea Level and Coastal Flooding.\n\nThe other graphs on the dashboard show levels of major atmospheric gasses. Though we won’t be dealing with these, either, in this activity set, here is a bit of useful background.\n\nOf the four gasses shown on the dashboard, one of these, oxygen, is a major constituent of atmosphere. At sea level, the atmosphere is approximately 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. The remaining 1% of the atmosphere is a combination of gasses that occur in such small concentrations that they are referred to as trace gasses.\n\nThree of these gasses (\\(CO_{2}\\), \\(CH_{4}\\), and \\(N_{2}O\\)) that appear in the dashboard are also Greenhouse Gasses. Their significance is explained in two earlier activity sets, Activity 4: Atmospheric Energy Budget and Activity 5: Carbon Cycle.\n\n9.02: Investigation\n\nActivity A – Browsing the Data\n\nBegin this part of the investigation by accessing the Global Temperature Record graph <https://www.temperaturerecord.org/>. What you should see should look like this Figure 9.1.1.\n\nIf you move your cursor over the blue plot line you can read the temperature anomaly for any one year. Note – this works a bit differently on the denser right-hand side of the plot. More about that later. The three bars in the upper right corner of graph is a pull-down menu that allows you to change the graph, print it, and so on. The clock symbol in the upper left corner expands the time scale to 800 thousand years.\n\nFor this activity use t",

What this definition fails to mention is that the change is based on a model developed by former colonial powers the result of which is “dislocated cultural space” (Inda and Rosaldo 2002:25). While western culture has historically taken precedence through the process of colonialism in more recent years that dominance has been challenged resulting in interconnected cultural space (Inda and Rosaldo 2002:26).\n\nPost WWII, development focused on rebuilding countries devastated by the global conflict. Impacting the course of development were two polarizing social ideologies: communism and democracy. Much of the economic and political development pursued by the United States was geared toward stopping the spread of communism. The goal was to help underdeveloped countries, or countries that did not economically use all their available resources to the degree deemed appropriate by the former colonial powers, become modern. The assumption was that all countries were on a universal path to modernity, an idea straight out of eighteenth century philosophies like social evolution (see theories section from the beginning of the quarter) and Social Darwinism. Several institutions were started to aid in development, particularly on the economic level: United Nations (UN), World Bank (WB), and International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe UN was chartered in 1945 with fifty-one countries as original members. The UN and its family of organizations work to promote respect for human rights, protect the environment, fight disease, foster development, and reduce poverty. It oversees progress and works to foster cooperation among nations. The UN has also become a “neutral” peacekeeper in more recent years, but it is totally dependent upon member nations to provide military and financial resources to fulfill its mission. The UN currently has 193 member states each of which has a single vote in the General Assembly. The UN Security Council, which is responsible for overseeing international peace and security, has fifteen members: five permanent members (China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and United States) and ten non-permanent members who are elected for a term of two-years by the General Assembly. Any nation can take part in discussions of the Security Council, but only the fifteen members have a vote. A student of history might recognize that the five permanent members of the Security Council were allies during WWII and represent the two post-WWII social ideologies mentioned above.\n\nFigure \\(1\\) - United Nations building, New York City.\n\nAt the same time that the UN was being organized, it was decided that an international banking system was integral to reconstruct the post-war world economy.

                "source_content": "When a company reaches the end of a period, it must update certain accounts that have either been left unattended throughout the period or have not yet been recognized. Adjusting entries update accounting records at the end of a period for any transactions that have not yet been recorded. One important accounting principle to remember is that just as the accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s equity/or common stock/or capital) must be equal, it must remain equal after you make adjusting entries. Also note that in this equation, owner’s equity represents an individual owner (sole proprietorship), common stock represents a corporation’s owners’ interests, and capital represents a partnership’s owners’ interests. We discuss the effects of adjusting entries in greater detail throughout this chapter.\n\nThere are several steps in the accounting cycle that require the preparation of a trial balance: step 4, preparing an unadjusted trial balance; step 6, preparing an adjusted trial balance; and step 9, preparing a post-closing trial balance. You might question the purpose of more than one trial balance. For example, why can we not go from the unadjusted trial balance straight into preparing financial statements for public consumption? What is the purpose of the adjusted trial balance? Does preparing more than one trial balance mean the company made a mistake earlier in the accounting cycle? To answer these questions, let’s first explore the (unadjusted) trial balance, and why some accounts have incorrect balances.\n\nWhy Some Accounts Have Incorrect Balances on the Trial Balance\n\nThe unadjusted trial balance may have incorrect balances in some accounts. Recall the trial balance from Analyzing and Recording Transactions for the example company, Printing Plus.\n\nThe trial balance for Printing Plus shows Supplies of \\$500, which were purchased on January 30. Since this is a new company, Printing Plus would more than likely use some of their supplies right away, before the end of the month on January 31. Supplies are only an asset when they are unused. If Printing Plus used some of its supplies immediately on January 30, then why is the full \\$500 still in the supply account on January 31? How do we fix this incorrect balance?\n\nSimilarly, what about Unearned Revenue? On January 9, the company received \\$4,000 from a customer for printing services to be performed. The company recorded this as a liability because it received payment without providing the service. To clear this liability, the company must perform the service. Assume that as of January 31 some of the printing services have been provided. Is the full \\$4,000 still a liability? Since a portion of the service was provided, a change to unearned revenue should occur. The company needs to correct this balance in the Unearned Revenue account.\n\nHaving incorrect balances in Supplies and in Unearned Revenue on the company’s January 31 trial balance is not due to any error on the company’s part.

Students of truth trees and of derivations will be able to apply the material of this section appropriately to what they have learned.\n\nMy completeness proofs for predicate logic assumed a finite set of sentences, Z. To get a full statement of completeness, where Z can be infinite, we need to show that the compactness result, T8, which we proved in chapter 14, also holds for predicate logic. To accomplish this we need to modify the idea of a tree of truth value assignments.\n\nHere's what we do. We can consider all possible closed atomic sentences written out in some definite order: the first atomic sentence letter, the second, the first one place predicate with the first name, the second . . . : 'A', 'B', 'Pa', 'Pb', 'Raa'. . . . To make sure that this is possible, again consider that we could write each such description of the atomic sentences in English and order them as in a dictionary.\n\nSay the closed atomic sentences are XI, X2, XS, . . . Then we can diagram all possible truth value assignments to these atomic sentences in the form of a tree:\n\nThe third line will catalogue the alternative truth values for X; underneath all the possibilities covered in lines 1 and 2, and so on.\n\nNote that each path through this tree represents an interpretation, indeed, just the sort of interpretations represented by open paths on a truth tree or semantic tableau derivation. We have seen. in the com~leteness proofs, how there must be at least one such interpretation for each consistent finite set of sentences. We now proceed very much as we did in predicate logic. Let Z be an infinite set of sentences all of the finite subsets of which are consistent. We list the sentences in some definite order, and consider the initial finite segments of this ordering: Z,, Zp, 5, . . . As we work down the lines of the tree, we close branches which conflict with some sentences in one of the 2;. Since all of the Z; are consistent. for each line of the tree, there will be an open branch reaching down to that line. Koenig's lemma tells us that there is then an infinite path through the tree. But (if you make the right sort of arrangement of when paths get closed) you will see that this infinite path represents an interpretation which makes true all the sentences in all the Zi. That is, this interpretation is a model of Z.\n\nExercise \\(1\\)\n\nEXERCISE 15-25. Following the suggestions. of the argument sketch given in the last paragraph, give a detailed proof of compactness for predicate logic.\n\nActually, we have done the work to prove the Lowenheim Skolem Theorem, a much stronger result, of fundamental importance in logic and set theory. In all my discussion of infinite interpretations, I have not mentioned the fact that there are different kinds of infinities. The infinity of the integers is the smallest, called, for obvious reasons, a Countable Infinity. However, ot",

The perspectives and needs of LGBT people should be routinely considered in public health efforts to improve the overall health of every person and eliminate health disparities.\n\nIn addition to considering the needs of LGBT people in programs designed to improve the health of entire communities, there is also a need for culturally competent medical care and prevention services that are specific to this population. Social inequality is often associated with poorer health status, and sexual orientation has been associated with multiple health threats. Members of the LGBT community are at increased risk for a number of health threats when compared to their heterosexual peers.

As a result of cultural and societal discrimination, many LGBT people suffer an added burden of stress and experience health disparities, such as:\n\n• Potential difficulties in getting or keeping health insurance, and possible employment instability.\n• Limited access to high quality health care that is responsive to LGBT health issues.\n• Mental health problems and unhealthy coping skills, such as substance abuse, risky sexual behaviors, and suicide attempts.\n• Challenges or difficulties with being open about one’s sexual orientation, which can increase stress, limit social support, and negatively affect overall health.\n\nThe effects of homophobia, stigma and discrimination can be especially hard on adolescents and young adults. In addition to an increased risk of being bullied at school, they are also at risk of being rejected by their families and, as a result, are at increased risk of homelessness.

                "source_content": "Norms\n\nSo far, the examples in this chapter have often described how people are expected to behave in certain situations—for example, when buying food or boarding a bus. These examples describe the visible and invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured, or what sociologists call norms. Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good, right, and important, and most members of the society adhere to them. Social norms have played a key role in the evolution of human cooperation, they support the young child understanding of being a member of a larger group and behaving in a way that supports the group. As noted in the social learning theory, children observe and follow the directives of adult caregivers; children conform and enforce social norms (Schmidt & Tomasello, 2012).\n\nFormal norms are established, written rules. They are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in order to suit and serve the most people. Laws are formal norms, but so are employee manuals, college entrance exam requirements, and “no running” signs at swimming pools. Formal norms are the most specific and clearly stated of the various types of norms, and they are the most strictly enforced. But even formal norms are enforced to varying degrees and are reflected in cultural values.\n\nFor example, money is highly valued in the United States, so monetary crimes are punished. It’s against the law to rob a bank, and banks go to great lengths to prevent such crimes. People safeguard valuable possessions and install antitheft devices to protect homes and cars. A less strictly enforced social norm is driving while intoxicated. While it’s against the law to drive drunk, drinking is for the most part an acceptable social behavior. And though there are laws to punish drunk driving, there are few systems in place to prevent the crime. These examples show a range of enforcement in formal norms.\n\nThere are plenty of formal norms, but the list of informal norms—casual behaviors that are generally and widely conformed to—is longer. People learn informal norms by observation, imitation, and general socialization. An example of cognitive methods of socialization in teaching children in the microsystems is is a parenting saying “Kiss your Aunt Edna” or “Use your napkin”—while others are learned by observation, including observations of the consequences when someone else violates a norm. But although informal norms define personal interactions, they extend into other systems as well. In the United States, there are informal norms regarding behavior at fast food restaurants. Customers line up to order their food and leave when they are done. They don’t sit down at a table with strangers, sing loudly as they prepare their condiments, or nap in a booth. Most people don’t commit even benign breaches of informal norms. Informal norms dictate appropriate behaviors without the need of written rules.\n\nNorms may be further classified as either mores or fol",

Though this book is only dealing with linear patterns, patterns can be exponential, logarithmic, or periodic. To see this pattern, you can draw a scatter plot of the data.\n\nRemember to read graphs from left to right, the same as you read words. If the graph goes up the correlation is positive and if the graph goes down the correlation is negative.\n\nThe words “ weak”, “moderate”, and “strong” are used to describe the strength of the relationship between the two variables.\n\nThe linear correlation coefficient is a number that describes the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. It is also called the Pearson correlation coefficient after Karl Pearson who developed it. The symbol for the sample linear correlation coefficient is r. The symbol for the population correlation coefficient is $\\rho$ (Greek letter rho).\n\nThe formula for r is\n\n$r=\\dfrac{S S_{x y}}{\\sqrt{S S_{x} S S_{y}}}$\n\nWhere\n\n$\\begin{array}{l}{S S_{x}=\\sum(x-\\overline{x})^{2}} \\ {S S_{y}=\\sum(y-\\overline{y})^{2}} \\ {S S_{x y}=\\sum(x-\\overline{x})(y-\\overline{y})}\\end{array}$\n\nAssumptions of linear correlation are the same as the assumptions for the regression line:\n\n1. The set (x, y) of ordered pairs is a random sample from the population of all such possible (x, y) pairs.\n2. For each fixed value of x, the y -values have a normal distribution. All of the y -distributions have the same variance, and for a given x-value, the distribution of y-values has a mean that lies on the least squares line. You also assume that for a fixed y, each x has its own normal distribution. This is difficult to figure out, so you can use the following to determine if you have a normal distribution.\n1. Look to see if the scatter plot has a linear pattern.\n2. Examine the residuals to see if there is randomness in the residuals. If there is a pattern to the residuals, then there is an issue in the data.\n\nNote\n\nInterpretation of the correlation coefficient\n\nr is always between -1 and 1. r = -1 means there is a perfect negative linear correlation and r = 1 means there is a perfect positive correlation. The closer r is to 1 or -1, the stronger the correlation. The closer r is to 0, the weaker the correlation.\n\nCAREFUL: r = 0 does not mean there is no correlation. It just means there is no linear correlation. There might be a very strong curved pattern.\n\nr\n\nHow strong is the positive relationship between the alcohol content and the number of calories in 12-ounce beer?

As the alloy cools α phase copper precipitates out first, changing the composition of the remaining melt. This may result in coring and dendritic growth as well as the formation of other phases such as the β phase when the zinc concentration in the remaining liquid is sufficiently high. Annealing the sample to aid diffusion means the composition becomes more uniform as zinc diffuses down the concentration gradient and a single phase predominates.\n\nAlpha-beta brass:\n\nAnother very common form of brass is α-β brass. α-β brasses have zinc concentrations of between about 30at.% and 45at.% and are two phase alloys.\n\nThe α phase precipitates out first and may form a Widmanstatten structure (see micrograph below), solidifying in plates along preferred growth directions.\n\nCopper-Tin Alloys:\n\nCu-Sn alloys are sometimes called bronzes, although this includes other kinds of copper alloys (e.g. with silicon and aluminium).\n\nCopper tin phase diagram showing a peritectic point\n\nThe peritectic reaction (see diagram above) is an important example of a microstructural transformation. Sn – 21wt.%Cu exhibits this transformation from a solid phase and a liquid phase to a different, solid phase.\n\nBefore the transformation begins the system is comprised of the ε phase and liquid. Below 415°C the equilibrium solid phase is η The peritectic transformation begins to take place at 415°C; the new phase precipitates heterogeneously on the surface of ε precipitates. The growing layer of η on the surface of the epsilon precipitates prevents the copper diffusing out to remove inhomogeneities, so some of the copper is trapped within the ε precipitates and the liquid has a lower Cu concentration than the bulk composition. This means the peritectic reaction never goes to completion (i.e. all liquid and solid going to the second solid). In this example the liquid continues to cool until it reaches the eutectic temperature, 227°C, when it transforms.\n\n8.5: Summary\n\nBy considering thermodynamics (phase diagrams) and some kinetics it is possible to gain an understanding of how a microstructure comes about.

The main aim of conservation biology is to ensure the long-term preservation of biodiversity. To achieve its aim, conservation biology has set three goals:\n\n• To document Earth’s biological diversity.\n• To investigate how humans influence species, evolution, and ecosystem processes.\n• To investigate practical approaches to protect and restore biological communities, maintain genetic diversity, and prevent the extinction of species.\n\nThe first two goals describe typical scientific research investigating objective facts. The third goal, however, is a part of what makes conservation biology a normative discipline; that is, conservation biology incorporates human values, not just facts, to understand and achieve its value-laden goals (Lindenmayer and Hunter, 2010). In this sense, conservation biology is related to environmentalism, in which people aim to protect the natural environment for its own sake (see Section 4.3.2). However, conservation biology is at its core a scientific discipline; it is founded on scientific principles. This is not to say you must be a scientist to practice conservation biology; there are many people who are not scientists who apply the principles of conservation biology in their professional and personal lives.\n\nThe emergence of conservation biology as a distinct scientific field in the 1970s has given rise to the formation of various formal societies representing the field in a united voice. Most notable among these is the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB, Figure 1.2), which is a non-profit international professional organization with a mission to advance “the science and practice of conserving the Earth’s biological diversity”. To facilitate opportunities where like-minded people can share ideas locally, the SCB has regional branches, including an active Africa Section (http://conbio.org/groups/sections/africa) which hosts regular conferences. In addition to the SCB, a great number of other local, national, and regional conservation organizations also exist and act as mouthpieces for grassroots movements and as custodians of nature. Many of these groups focus on specific animals or local protected areas. Others organically adapt their missions and visions in response to a specific need or threat. For example, established in 1913 as an exchange forum between collectors of rare plants, the Botanical Society of South Africa now actively works toward protecting those rare plants in their natural habitats.\n\nIn recent years, conservation practice has evolved from just a plan to save the environment to a vision that includes sustainable development and social justice.\n\nConservation biology also has a history of adapting to new challenges.

Particular attention will be given to the concept of logical form, the goal of formal logic in capturing logical form, and the explanation of validity in terms of logical form. We shall see how this understanding of the notion of validity allows us to identify what we call formal fallacies, which are mistakes in an argument due to its logical form. We shall also discuss some philosophical problems about the nature of logical forms. For the sake of simplicity, our focus will be on propositional logic. But many of the results to be discussed do not depend on this choice, and are applicable to more advanced logical systems.\n\nLogic, Validity, and Logical Forms\n\nDifferent sciences have different subject matters: physics tries to discover the properties of matter, history aims to discover what happened in the past, biology studies the development and evolution of living organisms, mathematics is, or at least seems to be, about numbers, sets, geometrical spaces, and the like. But what is it that logic investigates? What, indeed, is logic?\n\nThis is an essentially philosophical question, but its answer requires reflection on the status and behavior of logical rules and inferences. Textbooks typically present logic as the science of the relation of consequence that holds between the premises and the conclusion of a valid argument, where an argument is valid if it is not possible for its premises to be true and the conclusion false. If logic is the science of the relation of consequence that holds between the premises and the conclusion of a valid argument, we can say that logicians will be concerned with whether a conclusion of an argument is or is not a consequence of its premises.\n\nLet us examine the notion of validity with more care. For example, consider the following argument:\n\n1. If Alex is a sea bream, then Alex is not a rose.\n2. Alex is a rose.\n3. Alex is not a sea bream.\n\nIt can be shown that it is not possible for (1) and (2) to be true yet (3) false. Hence, the whole argument is valid. For convenience, let us represent each sentence of the argument into the standard propositional logic, which aims to analyze the structure and meaning of various propositions. To do this, we must first introduce the language of our logic.\n\n$(\\neg )$\n\nThus, if we use A for “Alex is a sea bream,” we can represent (1) with $A \\rightarrow \\neg B$, and represent our above argument (1)-(3) as follows:\n\n1. $A \\rightarrow \\neg B$\n2. $B$\n\nBut, recall, our aim was to examine why this argument, if at all, is valid. The mere representation of “not” by “$\\neg$” and “if … then” by “$\\rightarrow$” will not be sufficient to verify the validity or invalidity of a given argument: we also need to know what these symbols and the propositions they express mean. But how can we specify the meaning of “$\\neg$ ” and “$\\rightarrow$”?\n\nIt is plausible to say that if A is true, then its negation is false,",

Francis Fukuyama, in his monumental writing on political development and political decay (2011, 2014), points out that institutions that provide essential functions within a state often become so fixed over time in their original structures that they fail to adapt and adjust to changes in the external environment. We need therefore to examine in particular the roots of our modern educational systems, because teaching and learning in the present day is still strongly influenced by institutional structures developed many years ago. Thus, we need to examine the extent to which our traditional campus-based models of teaching remain fit for a digital age.\n\nThe large urban school, college or university, organized by age stratification, learners meeting in groups, and regulated units of time, was an excellent fit for an industrial society. In many ways it matched the way work was organised in factories. In effect, we still have a predominantly industrial model of educational design, which in large part remains our default design model even today.\n\nSome design models are so embedded in tradition and convention that we are often like fish in water – we just accept that this is the environment in which we have to live and breath. The classroom model is a very good example of this. In a classroom based model, learners are organised in classes that meet on a regular basis at the same place at certain times of the day for a given length of time over a given period (a term or semester).\n\nThis is a design decision that was taken more than 150 years ago. It was embedded in the social, economic and political context of the 19th century. This context included:\n\n• the industrialization of society which provided ‘models’ for organizing both work and labour, such as factories and mass production;\n• the movement of people from rural to urban occupations and communities, with increased density resulting in larger institutions;\n• the move to mass education to meet the needs of industrial employers and an increasingly large and complex range of state-managed activities, such as government, health and education;\n• voter enfranchisement and hence the need for a better educated voting public;\n• over time, demand for more equality, resulting in universal access to education.\n\nHowever, over the span of 150 years, our society has slowly changed. Many of these factors or conditions no longer exist, while others persist, but often in a less dominant way than in the past. Thus we still have factories and large industries, but we also have many more small companies, greater social and geographical mobility, and above all a massive development of new technologies that allow both work and education to be organized in different ways.\n\nThis is not to say that the classroom design model is in",

On Earth, 96.5% of the planet's water is found in seas and oceans, 1.7% in groundwater, 1.7% in glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, a small fraction in other large water bodies, and 0.001% in the air as vapour, clouds (formed from solid and liquid water particles suspended in air), and precipitation.\n\nOnly 2.5% of the Earth's water is freshwater, and 98.8% of that water is in ice and groundwater. Less than 0.3% of all freshwater is in rivers, lakes, and the atmosphere, and an even smaller amount of the Earth's freshwater (0.003%) is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.\n\nThe major chemical and physical properties of water are:\n\n• Water is a liquid at standard temperature and pressure. It is tasteless and odourless. The intrinsic colour of water and ice is a very slight blue hue, although both appear colourless in small quantities. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.\n• Water is the only substance occurring naturally in all three phases as solid, liquid, and gas on the Earth's surface\n• Water is transparent in the visible electromagnetic spectrum. Thus aquatic plants can live in water because sunlight can reach them. Infrared light is strongly absorbed by the hydrogen-oxygen or OH bonds.\n• Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity than hydrogen atoms, the oxygen atom carries a partial negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms have partial positive charges. As a result, water is a polar molecule with an electrical dipole moment.\n• Water can form an unusually large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (four) for a molecule of its size. These factors lead to strong attractive forces between molecules of water, giving rise to water's high surface tension and capillary forces. The capillary action refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of gravity. This property is relied upon by all vascular plants, such as trees.\n• The boiling point of water (like all other liquids) is dependent on the barometric pressure. For example, on the top of Mount Everest water boils at 68 °C, compared to 100 °C at sea level at a similar latitude (since latitude modifies atmospheric pressure slightly). Conversely, water deep in the ocean near geothermal vents can reach temperatures of hundreds of degrees and remain liquid.\n• Water has a high specific heat capacity, 4181.3 J kg-1 K-1, as well as a high heat of vaporization (40.65 kJ mol-1), both result from the extensive hydrogen bonding between its molecules. These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth's climate by buffering large fluctuations in temperature.\n• Solid ice has a density of 917 kg m-3. The maximum density of liquid water occurs at 3.98 °C where it is 1000 kg m-3.\n• Elements that are more electropositive than hydrogen such as lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium and caesium displ",

The solution lies with Fisher's $z'$ transformation described in the section on the sampling distribution of Pearson's r. The steps in computing a confidence interval for $\\rho$ are:\n\n1. Convert $r$ to $z'$.\n2. Compute a confidence interval in terms of $z'$.\n3. Convert the confidence interval back to $r$.\n\nLet's take the data from the case study Animal Research as an example. In this study, students were asked to rate the degree to which they thought animal research is wrong and the degree to which they thought it is necessary. As you might have expected, there was a negative relationship between these two variables: the more that students thought animal research is wrong, the less they thought it is necessary. The correlation based on $34$ observations is $-0.654$. The problem is to compute a $95\\%$ confidence interval on $\\rho$ based on this $r$ of $-0.654$.\n\nThe conversion of $r$ to $z'$ can be done using a calculator. This calculator shows that the $z'$ associated with an $r$ of $-0.654$ is $-0.78$.\n\nThe sampling distribution of $z'$ is approximately normally distributed and has a standard error of\n\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N-3}}$\n\nFor this example, $N = 34$ and therefore the standard error is $0.180$. The $Z$ for a $95\\%$ confidence interval ($Z_{0.95}$) is $1.96$, as can be found using the normal distribution calculator (setting the shaded area to $0.95$ and clicking on the \"Between\" button). The confidence interval is therefore computed as:\n\n$\\text{Lower limit} = -0.775 - (1.96)(0.18) = -1.13$\n\n$\\text{Upper limit} = -0.775 + (1.96)(0.18) = -0.43$\n\nThe final step is to convert the endpoints of the interval back to $r$ using a calculator. The $r$ associated with a $z'$ of $-1.13$ is $-0.81$ and the $r$ associated with a $z'$ of $-0.43$ is $-0.40$. Therefore, the population correlation ($\\rho$) is likely to be between $-0.81$ and $-0.40$. The $95\\%$ confidence interval is:\n\n$-0.81 \\leq \\rho \\leq -0.40$\n\nTo calculate the $99\\%$ confidence interval, you use the $Z$ for a $99\\%$ confidence interval of $2.58$ as follows:\n\n$\\text{Lower limit} = -0.775 - (2.58)(0.18) = -1.24$\n\n$\\text{Upper limit} = -0.775 + (2.58)(0.18) = -0.32$\n\nConverting back to $r$, the confidence interval is:\n\n$-0.84 \\leq \\rho \\leq -0.31$\n\nNaturally, the $99\\%$ confidence interval is wider than the $95\\%$ confidence interval.\n\n10.12: Proportion\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n• Estimate the population proportion from sample proportions\n• Apply the correction for continuity\n• Compute a confidence interval\n\nA candidate in a two-person election commissions a poll to determine who is ahead.

Obesity is at the root of it all. Claude Bouchard (2007) identified factors contributing to the global epidemic of obesity and the diseases associated with it. These are the built environment and the social environment, which together form the obesogenic environment in which unhealthy behaviors are encouraged. This chapter will close by examining each of these in a college context.\n\nIn terms of the built environment, consider your campus or neighborhood from an evolutionary perspective. To what degree does the construction of the space lend itself to physical activity as part of daily life? Is your campus constructed in such a way that it promotes the use of automobiles at the expense of walking or biking? If driving is necessary, is parking available close to the buildings or do you need to walk a fair distance from the parking lot to your destination? Do the buildings have stairs or ramps or is it necessary to take the elevator? Is it possible to negotiate safely around campus or the neighborhood on foot or by bike in all weather? After dark? How about the classrooms and computer labs? Do they have standing or treadmill desks as options? Does your class schedule encourage walking from building to building between classes, or are most courses in your major scheduled in the same location? I regularly have students who sit in the same room for hours, not even changing desks, while instructors rush from place to place. Most college majors also lack a physical activity requirement, leaving it up to students to incorporate exercise into already-busy schedules (See Figure 16.12).\n\nSociocultural factors that contribute to obesity include food advertising, ubiquitous fast-food and junk food options, and social pressure to consume, all of which are present on college campuses. Although nutritional options on campuses have improved in recent years, many students find eating healthy in the dining halls and dorms challenging (Plotnikoff et al. 2015), and students who live off campus fare even worse (Small et al. 2013). There are also parties and other social events, a normal part of college life, that often involve unhealthy food and encourage behaviors like alcohol consumption and smoking. Give some thought to the social atmosphere on your campus and the ways in which it may contribute to obesity. My own freshman orientation involved a succession of pizza parties, ice cream socials, and barbecues, followed by late-night runs to the nearest fast-food outlet. The purpose of these events was to encourage people to make friends and feel comfortable living away from home, but the foods served were not healthy, and there was social pressure to join in and be part of the group. Such activities set students up for the “freshman fifteen” and then some. They als",

                "source_content": "In this chapter, we will be talking primarily about the Hydrogen atom. However, a lot of what we are saying will be an approximation to other atoms. In the Hydrogen atom, there are just two particles interacting, an electron and a proton. The proton is more than a thousand times more massive than the electron. That means that as a result of their interaction, the electron moves far more than the proton does. As such, we can view it as an electron moving about in the potential of the proton. Except for the fact that it provides this potential, to first order we can ignore the proton, and just consider the electron as the quantum mechanical particle.\n\nFor other atoms, there are additional electrons. The energy levels that we have calculated for Hydrogen can very easily be adapted to take into account a nucleus with more protons— all you have to do is multiply all of the energy levels by \\(Z^{2}\\), the square of the number of protons in the nucleus (which is also the positive charge of the nucleus). We can then approximate other atoms by putting electrons into all of these energy levels. Because electrons are fermions, we can only put two into any given orbital. (Two because there are two possible spin states for an electron.) However, this implicitly assumes that the electrons are interacting only with the nucleus, and not with each other. That approximation will allow us to get a lot of insight into the structure of (for example) the Periodic Table of the elements, but is too much of an approximation to be able to figure out precise energy levels. \n\n14: Atomic Orbitals \n\nThe one-dimensional Coulomb potential was presented in section 13.6. Of course, the real Hydrogen atom is three-dimensional. The Schr¨odinger equation that results is almost identical:\n\n$\\hat{K} \\psi(\\vec{r})+V(r) \\psi(\\vec{r})=E \\psi(\\vec{r})\\tag{14.1}$\n\nFirst, remember that when we say $\\psi(\\vec{r})$, that’s a shorthand for $\\psi(x, y, z)$. On the left, we’ve broken the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ into the kinetic energy part $(\\hat{K})$ and the potential. Notice that in here, we don’t have $V(x, y, z)$, but only $V(r)$. When we say $r$ without the little vector arrow, we mean the distance from the origin, that is, $r=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}$. The potential here is spherically symmetric. Because it depends only on the origin, if you rotated the whole system through any angle, the potential would be no different.\n\nIf we substitute in the correct expression for the potential $V(r)$, this equation becomes:\n\n$\\hat{K} \\psi(\\vec{r})-\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0}} \\frac{e^{2}}{r} \\psi(\\vec{r})=E \\psi(\\vec{r})\\tag{14.2}$\n\nAs noted in the previous chapter, the potential is always negative. As $r$ gets very large (i.e. the electron is very far away from the proton), the potential approaches zero. Again, this is just a convention; we could add any constant we wanted to the potential without changing the physics of what’s happening. We’ve chosen this because it’s convenient not to have to worry a",

In a welcoming environment, families feel that they belong and seek ways to contribute to the program. They become comfortable with exchanging information with their children’s teachers and open to exploring ways to bring learning activities from the preschool program to home. An essential part of a welcoming environment for families with dual language learners is the program ensuring that they have opportunities to communicate in their home language. Encouraging communication between families with dual language learners who share a home language, hiring staff members (when possible) who are able to communicate in the families’ home language, and providing translations help the families to feel welcome in the preschool setting. \n\n08: Welcoming and Supporting Families \n\nCreating a Welcoming Space\n\nPrograms\n\n• Express a warm welcome by having staff and teachers greet families at the door.\n• Offer a family room, where family members can mingle with one another and access information on child development.\n• Make a private space available for families and staff to communicate with one another.\n• Arrange for support so families with dual language learners can use the home language to communicate with teachers and other program staff members.\n\nPrograms Regularly Provide Family Members with Information about Their Children’s Learning and Development, Well-Being, And Everyday Experiences\n\nA key to building successful partnerships with parents is to make them true partners by sharing with them the same kinds of educational information and ideas that are important to the teacher and staff. In a high-quality program, there is ongoing communication between the home and the early care and education center. As much as possible, what the children learn in the program should be supported and reinforced at home.\n\nFamily practices in the home are also important for young dual language learners to learn, practice, and reinforce concepts in their home language that were initially introduced in school, such as literacy-building skills. Recent research suggests the use of families’ home language is a protective factor for children of immigrant families. When some amount of the family’s native language is used regularly in the home, young dual language learners show improved cognitive and social development. Thus, it is important for preschool programs to encourage learning at home in dual language learners’ home languages. This may be particularly beneficial in the realm of reading and literacy-",

When we include atomic physics in our calculations, it seems that the Balmer lines should grow stronger and stronger as stars grow hotter and hotter. But the observations show that the Balmer lines decrease in strength at temperatures beyond 10,000 Kelvin. What's going on?\n\nThe problem isn't the atomic physics, per se. It's that we simply haven't included enough atomic physics. The Boltzmann equation tells us about the relative populations of a given species of atom: neutral hydrogen is one species, ionized hydrogen is a second, singly-ionized calcium is a third. What we have not YET considered is the interaction between species.\n\nThe missing piece: ionization?\n\nOur calculations yesterday assumed that all the hydrogen atoms in a star's photosphere were neutral; or, more accurately, it provided the ratio of neutral atoms in the n=2 state to the n=1 state. But what if the number of neutral atoms changes drastically from A stars to B stars? That might cause there to be many more neutral atoms in the n=2 state in an A star, even if its temperature is lower than that of a B star.\n\nHmmmm. How to find the fraction of H atoms which are neutral? As a very rough first try, we might say, \"When the temperature rises high enough that the typical kinetic energy of atoms reaches the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom, then the material becomes ionized.\" In other words,\n\n$k T \\sim E_{\\text {ionize }}=E_{\\infty}-E_{1}$\n\nExercise $1$\n\n1. At what temperature will the \"typical\" collision cause a hydrogen atom to be ionized from its ground state?\n2. How does that compare to the temperature of A and B stars?\n\nWell, that doesn't seem to explain the situation with A and B stars, does it?\n\nThe partition function\n\nHold on a moment -- that calculation shows that stars must be REALLY hot in order for a collision to ionize a hydrogen atom in its ground state. But what about atoms in excited states? The first excited level, n=2, is more than halfway from the ground state to the ionization energy. If we include atoms of all levels in the calculations, we might discover that even stars with relatively low temperatures can ionize most of the hydrogen in their photospheres.\n\nIn order to do this calculation properly, we need to form a weighted average of the fraction of neutral atoms in each energy state.\n\n$Z=g_{1}+\\sum_{j=2}^{\\infty} g_{j} e^{-\\left(E_{j}-E_{1}\\right) / k T}$\n\nIf we can form the partition function of all hydrogen atoms in the neutral stage -- call that $\\mathbf{Z_I}$ -- and the partition function of all hydrogen atoms in the ionized stage -- call that $\\mathbf{Z_{II}}$ -- then we can use the Saha equation to compute the relative number of atoms in each ionization stage.\n\n$\\frac{N_{I I}}{N_{I}}=\\frac{2 Z_{I I}}{n_{e} Z_{I}}\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m_{e} k T}{h^{2}}\\right)^{3 / 2} e^{-\\chi / k T}$\n\nIn this equation, $\\mathbf{n_e}$ is the number density of free electrons, and $\\mathbf{χ}$ is the energy required to ionize a hydrogen a",

This condition occurs in dry, stagnant air masses, usually stabilized by a temperature inversion (see Figure 8.1), that are subjected to intense sunlight. A smoggy atmosphere contains ozone, O3, organic oxidants, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, and other noxious species. In latter stages of smog formation visibility in the atmosphere is lowered by the presence of a haze of fine particles formed by the oxidation of organic compounds in smog.\n\nThe chemical ingredients of smog are nitrogen oxides and organic compounds, both released from the automobile, as well as from other sources. The driving energy force behind smog formation is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength at around 400 nm or less, in the ultraviolet region, just shorter than the lower limit for visible light. Energy absorbed by a molecule from this radiation can result in the formation of active species, thus initiating photochemical reactions.\n\nAlthough methane, CH4, is one of the least active hydrocarbons in terms of forming smog, it will be used here to show the smog formation process because it is the simplest hydrocarbon molecule. Smog is produced in a series of chain reactions. The first of these occurs when a photon of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength less than 398 nm is absorbed by a molecule of nitrogen dioxide.\n\n$\\ce{NO2 } h \\nu \\rightarrow \\ce{NO + O}$\n\nto produce an oxygen atom, O. The oxygen atom is a very reactive species that can abstract a hydrogen atom from methane,\n\n$\\ce{CH4 + O \\rightarrow HO \\cdot + H3C \\cdot}$\n\nto produce a methyl radical, H3C•, and a hydroxyl radical, HO•. In these formulas, the dot shows a single unpaired electron. A chemical species with such a single electron is a free radical. The hydroxyl radical is especially important in the formation of smog and in a wide variety of other kinds of photochemical reactions. The methyl radical can react with an oxygen molecule,\n\n$\\ce{H3C \\cdot + O2 \\rightarrow H3COO \\cdot}$\n\nto produce a methylperoxyl radical, H3COO•. This is a strongly oxidizing, reactive species. One of the very important reactions of peroxyl radicals is their reaction with NO, produced in the photochemical dissociation of NO2 (see Reaction 8.10.1 above),\n\n$\\ce{NO + H3COO \\cdot \\rightarrow NO2 + H3COO \\cdot}$\n\nTo regenerate NO2, which can undergo photodissociation, re-initiating the series of chain reactions by which smog is formed. Literally hundreds of other reactions can occur, leading eventually to oxidized organic matter that produces the small particulate matter characteristic of smog.\n\nAs the process of smog formation occurs, numerous noxious intermediates are generated. One of the main ones of these is ozone, O3, and it is the single species most characteristic of smog.

                "source_content": "The performance of the BinaryTrie structure is not very impressive. The number of elements, $\\mathtt{n}$, stored in the structure is at most $2^{\\mathtt{w}}$, so $\\log \\mathtt{n}\\le \\mathtt{w}$. In other words, any of the comparison-based SSet structures described in other parts of this book are at least as efficient as a BinaryTrie, and are not restricted to only storing integers.\n\nNext we describe the XFastTrie, which is just a BinaryTrie with $\\mathtt{w+1}$ hash tables--one for each level of the trie. These hash tables are used to speed up the $\\mathtt{find(x)}$ operation to $O(\\log \\mathtt{w})$ time. Recall that the $\\mathtt{find(x)}$ operation in a BinaryTrie is almost complete once we reach a node, $\\mathtt{u}$, where the search path for $\\mathtt{x}$ would like to proceed to $\\texttt{u.right}$ (or $\\texttt{u.left}$) but $\\mathtt{u}$ has no right (respectively, left) child. At this point, the search uses $\\texttt{u.jump}$ to jump to a leaf, $\\mathtt{v}$, of the BinaryTrie and either return $\\mathtt{v}$ or its successor in the linked list of leaves. An XFastTrie speeds up the search process by using binary search on the levels of the trie to locate the node $\\mathtt{u}$.\n\nTo use binary search, we need a way to determine if the node $\\mathtt{u}$ we are looking for is above a particular level, $\\mathtt{i}$, of if $\\mathtt{u}$ is at or below level $\\mathtt{i}$. This information is given by the highest-order $\\mathtt{i}$ bits in the binary representation of $\\mathtt{x}$; these bits determine the search path that $\\mathtt{x}$ takes from the root to level $\\mathtt{i}$. For an example, refer to Figure $1$; in this figure the last node, $\\mathtt{u}$, on search path for 14 (whose binary representation is 1110) is the node labelled $11{\\star\\star}$ at level 2 because there is no node labelled $111{\\star}$ at level 3. Thus, we can label each node at level $\\mathtt{i}$ with an $\\mathtt{i}$-bit integer. Then, the node $\\mathtt{u}$ we are searching for would be at or below level $\\mathtt{i}$ if and only if there is a node at level $\\mathtt{i}$ whose label matches the highest-order $\\mathtt{i}$ bits of $\\mathtt{x}$.\n\nIn an XFastTrie, we store, for each $\\mathtt{i}\\in\\{0,\\ldots,\\mathtt{w}\\}$, all the nodes at level $\\mathtt{i}$ in a USet, $\\mathtt{t[i]}$, that is implemented as a hash table (Chapter 5). Using this USet allows us to check in constant expected time if there is a node at level $\\mathtt{i}$ whose label matches the highest-order $\\mathtt{i}$ bits of $\\mathtt{x}$. In fact, we can even find this node using $\\mathtt{t[i]\\texttt{.}find(x\\text{>>>}(w-i))}$\n\nThe hash tables $\\mathtt{t[0]},\\ldots,\\mathtt{t[w]}$ allow us to use binary search to find $\\mathtt{u}$. Initially, we know that $\\mathtt{u}$ is at some level $\\mathtt{i}$ with $0\\le \\mathtt{i}< \\mathtt{w}+1$. We therefore initialize $\\mathtt{l}=0$ and $\\mathtt{h}=\\mathtt{w}+1$ and repeatedly look at the hash table $\\mathtt{t[i]}$, where $\\mathtt{i}=\\lfloor(\\mathtt{l+h})/2\\rfloor$.

When we summarize data, our goal is to report quantitative characteristics, or statistics, that we can use to provide clearer statements about the differences and the similarities between results for different variables, or between the results for a variable and an expected result already known to us. In this part of the case study we consider several useful statistics that we can use to summarize the data for our samples.\n\nInvestigation 15.\n\nBefore we consider ways to summarize our data, we need to draw a distinction between a sample and a population. We collect and analyze samples with the hope that we can deduce something about the properties of the population.

Loosely speaking, a ring is a set together with two binary operations (called addition and multiplication) that are related via a distributive property.\n\nDefinition: Ring\n\nA ring $R$ is a set together with two binary operations $+$ and $\\cdot$ (called addition and multiplication, respectively) satisfying the following:\n\n1. $(R,+)$ is an abelian group.\n2. $\\cdot$ is associative: $(a\\cdot b)\\cdot c=a\\cdot (b\\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\\in R$.\n3. The distributive property holds: $a\\cdot (b+c)=(a\\cdot b)+(a\\cdot c)$ and $(a+b)\\cdot c = (a\\cdot c)+(b\\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\\in R$.\n\nRemark $1$\n\nWe make a couple comments about notation.\n\n1. We often write $ab$ in place of $a\\cdot b$.\n2. The additive inverse of the ring element $a\\in R$ is denoted $-a$.\n\nTheorem $1$\n\nIf $R$ is a ring, then for all $a,b\\in R$:\n\n1. $0a=a0=0$\n2. $(-a)b=a(-b)=-(ab)$\n3. $(-a)(-b)=ab$\n\nDefinition: Commutative\n\nA ring $R$ is called commutative if multiplication is commutative.\n\nDefinition: Identity\n\nA ring $R$ is said to have an identity (or called a ring with 1) if there is an element $1\\in R$ such that $1a=a 1=a$ for all $a\\in R$.\n\nProblem $1$\n\nJustify that $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a commutative ring with 1 under the usual operations of addition and multiplication. Which elements have multiplicative inverses in $\\mathbb{Z}$?\n\nProblem $2$\n\nJustify that $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a commutative ring with 1 under addition and multiplication mod $n$.\n\nProblem $3$: $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ Ring\n\n[prob:Z10Ring] Consider the set $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}=\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$. Which elements have multiplicative inverses in $\\mathbb{Z}_{10}$?\n\nProblem $4$\n\nFor each of the following, find a positive integer $n$ such that the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n$ does not have the stated property.\n\n1. $a^2=a$ implies $a=0$ or $a=1$.\n2. $ab=0$ implies $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n3. $ab=ac$ and $a\\neq 0$ imply $b=c$.\n\nTheorem $2$\n\nIf $R$ is a ring with 1, then the multiplicative identity is unique and $-a=(-1)a$.\n\nProblem $5$\n\nRequiring $(R,+)$ to be a group is fairly natural, but why require $(R,+)$ to be abelian?

                "source_content": "Solving Nonhomogeneous Equations\n\nWe have solved linear constant coefficient homogeneous equations. What about nonhomogeneous linear ODEs? For example, the equations for forced mechanical vibrations. That is, suppose we have an equation such as\n\n$y'' + 5y' + 6y = 2x + 1 \\label{2.5.1}$\n\nWe will write $Ly = 2x + 1$ when the exact form of the operator is not important. We solve (Equation \\ref{2.5.1}) in the following manner. First, we find the general solution $y_c$ to the associated homogeneous equation\n\n$\\label{eq:2}y'' + 5y' + 6y = 0$\n\nWe call $y_c$ the complementary solution. Next, we find a single particular solution $y_p$ to $\\eqref{2.5.1}$ in some way. Then\n\n$y = y_c + y_p \\nonumber$\n\nis the general solution to $\\eqref{2.5.1}$. We have $Ly_c = 0$ and $Ly_p = 2x +1$. As $L$ is a linear operator we verify that $y$ is a solution, $Ly = L(y_c + y_p) = Ly_c + Ly_p = 0 + ( 2x + 1)$. Let us see why we obtain the general solution.\n\nLet $y_p$ and ${\\tilde {y}}_p$ be two different particular solutions to $\\eqref{2.5.1}$. Write the difference as $w = y_p - {\\tilde {y}}_p$. Then plug $w$ into the left hand side of the equation to get\n\n$w'' + 5w' + 6w = ( y''_p + 5y'_p + 6y_p ) - (\\tilde {y}_p'' +5 \\tilde {y}_p' +6 \\tilde {y}_p)= ( 2x + 1) - (2x + 1) = 0 \\nonumber$\n\nUsing the operator notation the calculation becomes simpler. As $L$ is a linear operator we write\n\n$Lw = L (y_p - {\\tilde {y}}_p ) = L y_p - L {\\tilde {y}}_p = (2x + 1) - ( 2x + 1) = 0 \\nonumber$\n\nSo $w = y_p - {\\tilde {y}}_p$ is a solution to $\\eqref{eq:2}$, that is $Lw = 0$. Any two solutions of $\\eqref{2.5.1}$ differ by a solution to the homogeneous equation $\\eqref{eq:2}$. The solution $y = y_c + y_p$ includes all solutions to $\\eqref{2.5.1}$, since $y_c$ is the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation.\n\nTheorem $1$\n\nLet $Ly = f(x)$ be a linear ODE (not necessarily constant coefficient). Let $y_c$ be the complementary solution (the general solution to the associated homogeneous equation $Ly = 0$) andlet $y_p$ be any particular solution to $Ly = f(x)$. Then the general solution to $Ly = f(x)$ is\n\n$y = y_c + y_p . \\nonumber$\n\nThe moral of the story is that we can find the particular solution in any old way. If we find a different particular solution (by a different method, or simply by guessing), then we still get the same general solution. The formula may look different, and the constants we will have to choose to satisfy the initial conditions may be different, but it is the same solution.\n\nUndetermined Coefficients\n\nThe trick is to somehow, in a smart way, guess one particular solution to $\\eqref{2.5.1}$. Note that $2x + 1$ is a polynomial, and the left hand side of the equation will be a polynomial if we let $y$ be a polynomial of the same degree. Let us try\n\n$y_p = Ax + B \\nonumber$\n\nWe plug in to obtain\n\n\\begin{align}\\begin{aligned} y_p'' + 5y_p' + 6y_p &= (Ax + B)'' + 5( Ax + B)' + 6(Ax + B) \\ &= 0 + 5A + 6Ax + 6B = 6Ax + ( 5A + 6B) \\end{aligned}\\end{align} \\nonumber\n\nS",

Although the early texts and events are impossible to date with precision, the general chronological development is clear.\n\nA. Vedic Civilization\n\nAbout 2000 BC, a highly developed civilization flourished in the Indus Valley, around the sites of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. By about 1500 BC, when the Indo-Aryan tribes invaded India, this civilization was in a serious decline. It is therefore impossible to know, on present evidence, whether or not the two civilizations had any significant contact. Many elements of Hinduism that were not present in Vedic civilization (such as worship of the phallus and of goddesses, bathing in temple tanks, and the postures of yoga) may have been derived from the Indus civilization, however. See Indus Valley Civilization.\n\nBy about 1500 BC, the Indo-Aryans had settled in the Punjab, bringing with them their predominantly male Indo-European pantheon of gods and a simple warrior ethic that was vigorous and worldly, yet also profoundly religious. Gods of the Vedic pantheon survive in later Hinduism, but no longer as objects of worship: Indra, king of the gods and god of the storm and of fertility; Agni, god of fire; and Soma, god of the sacred, intoxicating Soma plant and the drink made from it. By 900 BC the use of iron allowed the Indo-Aryans to move down into the lush Ganges Valley, where they developed a far more elaborate civilization and social system. By the 6th century BC, Buddhism had begun to make its mark on India and what was to be more than a millennium of fruitful interaction with Hinduism.\n\nB. Classical Hindu Civilization\n\nFrom about 200 BC to AD 500 India was invaded by many northern powers, of which the Shakas (Scythians) and Kushanas had the greatest impact. This was a time of great flux, growth, syncretism, and definition for Hinduism and is the period in which the epics, the Dharmashastras, and the Dharmasutras took final form. Under the Gupta Empire (320-550?), when most of northern India was under a single power, classical Hinduism found its most consistent expression: the sacred laws were codified, the great temples began to be built, and myths and rituals were preserved in the Puranas.\n\nC. Rise of Devotional Movements\n\nIn the post-Gupta period, a less rigid and more eclectic form of Hinduism emerged, with more dissident sects and vernacular movements. At this time, too, the great devotional movements arose. Many of the sects that emerged during the period from 800 to 1800 are still active in India today.\n\nMost of the bhakti movements are said to have been founded by saints—the gurus by whom the tradition has been handed down in unbroken lineage, from guru to disciple (chela). This lineage, in addition to a written canon, is the basis for the authority of the bhakti sect. Other traditions are based on the teachings of such philosophers as Shankara and Ramanuja. Shankara was the exponent ",

The reason we look at this material here is that these are “real waves”, hopefully not too difficult to think about, and yet mathematically they are the solutions of the same wave equation the Schrödinger wavefunction obeys in various contexts, so should be helpful in visualizing solutions to that equation, in particular for the hydrogen atom.\n\n• 2.1: The One-Dimensional Wave Equation\nThe mathematical description of the one-dimensional waves can be expressed as solutions to the \"wave equation.\" It may not be surprising that not all possible waves will satisfy the wave equation for a specific system since waves solutions must satisfy both the initial conditions and the boundary conditions. This results in a subset of possible solutions. In the quantum world, this means that the boundary conditions are responsible somehow for the quantization phenomena in Chapter 1.\n• 2.2: The Method of Separation of Variables\nMethod of separation of variables is one of the most widely used techniques to solve partial differential equations and  is based on the assumption that the solution of the equation is separable, that is, the final solution can be represented as a product of several functions, each of which is only dependent upon a single independent variable. If this assumption is incorrect, then clear violations of mathematical principles will be obvious from the analysis.\n• 2.3: Oscillatory Solutions to Differential Equations\nCharacterizing the spatial and temporal components of a wave requires solving homogeneous second order linear differential equations with constant coefficients. This results in oscillatory solutions (in space and time). These solutions solved via specific boundary conditions are standing waves.\n• 2.4: The General Solution is a Superposition of Normal Modes\nSince the wave equation is a linear differential equations, the Principle of Superposition holds and the combination two solutions is also a solution.\n• 2.5: A Vibrating Membrane\nIt is pleasant to find that these waves in higher dimensions satisfy wave equations which are a very natural extension of the one we found for a string, and—very important—they also satisfy the Principle of Superposition, in other words, if waves meet, you just add the contribution from each wave.  In the next two paragraphs, we go into more detail, but this Principle of Superposition is the crucial lesson.\n• 2.E: The Classical Wave Equation (Exercises)\nThese are homework exercises to accompany Chapter 2 of McQuarrie and Simon's \"Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach\" Textmap. \n\n02: The Classical Wave Equation \n\nLearning Objectives\n• To introduce the wave equation including time and position dependence\n\nIn the most",

We call $T\\in\\mathcal{L}(V)$ normal if $TT^*=T^*T$.\n\nGiven an arbitrary operator $T \\in \\mathcal{L}(V)$, we have that $TT^*\\neq T^*T$ in general. However, both $TT^*$ and $T^*T$ are self-adjoint, and any self-adjoint operator $T$ is normal. We now give a different characterization for normal operators in terms of norms.\n\nProposition 11.2.2. Let $V$ be a complex inner product space, and suppose that $T\\in\\mathcal{L}(V)$ satisfies\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\inner{Tv}{v} = 0, \\quad \\text{for all $v\\in V$.}\n\\end{equation*}\nThen $T=0$.\n\nProof. You should be able to verify that\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n\\inner{Tu}{w} = \\frac{1}{4} & \\left\\{ \\inner{T(u+w)}{u+w} - \\inner{T(u-w)}{u-w}\\right.\\\n& \\left.+i \\inner{T(u+iw)}{u+iw} - i \\inner{T(u-iw)}{u-iw} \\right\\} .\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\nSince each term on the right-hand side is of the form $\\inner{Tv}{v}$, we obtain 0 for each $u,w\\in V$.\nHence $T=0$.\n\nProposition 11.2.3. Let $T\\in \\mathcal{L}(V)$. Then $T$ is normal if and only if\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\norm{Tv} = \\norm{T^* v}, \\quad \\text{for all $v\\in V$.}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nProof. Note that\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{$T$ is normal} & \\Longleftrightarrow T^*T-TT^* =0\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\inner{(T^*T-TT^*)v}{v} = 0, \\quad \\text{for all $v\\in V$}\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\inner{TT^* v}{v} = \\inner{T^*T v}{v}, \\quad \\text{for all $v\\in V$}\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow \\norm{Tv}^2 = \\norm{T^*v}^2, \\quad \\text{for all $v\\in V$.}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nCorollary 11.2.4. Let $T \\in \\mathcal{L}(V)$ be a normal operator.\n\n1. $\\kernel(T) = \\kernel(T^*)$.\n2. If $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is an eigenvalue of $T$, then $\\overline{\\lambda}$ is an eigenvalue of $T^*$ with the same eigenvector.\n3. If $\\lambda,\\mu\\in\\mathbb{C}$ are distinct eigenvalues of $T$ with associated eigenvectors $v,w\\in V$, respectively, then $\\inner{v}{w}=0$.\nProof. Note that Part~1 follows from Proposition 11.2.3 and the positive definiteness of the norm.\n\nTo prove Part~2, first verify that if $T$ is normal, then $T-\\lambda I$ is also normal with $(T-\\lambda I)^* = T^* - \\overline{\\lambda} I$. Therefore, by Proposition 11.2.3, we have\n\\begin{equation*}\n0 = \\norm{(T-\\lambda I) v} = \\norm{(T-\\lambda I)^* v} = \\norm{(T^*-\\overline{\\lambda} I)v},\n\\end{equation*}\nand so $v$ is an eigenvector of $T^*$ with eigenvalue $\\overline{\\lambda}$.\n\nUsing Part~2, note that\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n(\\lambda-\\mu)\\inner{v}{w} = \\inner{\\lambda v}{w} - \\inner{v}{\\overline{\\mu} w}\n= \\inner{Tv}{w} - \\inner{v}{T^* w} = 0.\n\\end{equation*}\n\nSince $\\lambda-\\mu\\neq 0$ it follows that $\\inner{v}{w}=0$, proving Part~3.\n\nContributors\n\nBoth hardbound and softbound versions of this textbook are available online at WorldScientific.com.\n\n11.03: Normal operators and the spectral decomposition\n\nRecall that an operator $T \\in \\mathcal{L}(V)$ is diagonalizable if there exists a ba",

In 919 C.E., they chose Henry the Liudolfing, the son of a high-ranking duke, a brilliant military strategist and a well-respected leader. Henry, dubbed “the Fowler” because of his hobby of bird hunting, led the Saxon armies to a number of decisive victories against the Magyars and the Danes. These newly secured borders ushered in a period of immense prosperity and artistic productivity for the Saxon empire.\n\nHenry’s son Otto I (who became emperor in 962) lends his name to the “Ottonian” period. He forged an important alliance with the Pope, which allowed him to be crowned the first official Holy Roman Emperor since 924. This contact with Rome was extremely important to Ottonian artistic development, since each Ottonian king was determined to define himself as a Roman Emperor in the style of Constantine and Charlemagne. This meant perpetuating a highly intellectual court and creating an extensive artistic legacy.\n\nOttonian art takes a number of traditional medieval forms, including elegantly illuminated manuscripts, lavish metalwork, intricate carving, and Romanesque churches and cathedrals. Perhaps the most famous of the Ottonian artistic innovations is the Saxon Romanesque architecture style, which is marked by a careful attention to balance and mathematical harmony. This focus on geometry is based on the texts de Arithmatica and Ars Geometriae by the 6th century philosopher Boethius. The Ottonians held mathematical sciences in high regard and this is reflected in many of their artistic productions.\n\nThe illuminated manuscripts produced by Ottonian “scriptoria,” or monastery painting and writing schools, provide documentation of both Ottonian religious and political customs and the stylistic preferences of the period. Manuscripts were most often produced of religious texts, and usually included a dedication portrait commemorating the book’s creation. The royal or religious donor is usually shown presenting the book to the saint of his or her choice.\n\nHere we see a powerful abbess, Uta, presenting her codex to St. Mary.

An obvious example is the brittleness and low tensile strength of pig iron, characteristics which make it suitable for casting, but little else. These adverse properties are due to the presence of impurities, a typical analysis of blast-furnace iron showing about 4% C, 2% P, 2.5%, Si, 2.5%Mn, and 0.1% S by weight. Further refining to remove these impurities (especially carbon) produces steel, a much stronger and consequently more useful material.\n\nSteel making involves oxidation of the impurities in basic oxygen, open hearth, or electric furnaces. Some oxidation products (CO, CO2, and SO2) are volatile and easily separated. The others end up, along with some iron oxides, in a slag which floats on the surface of the molten steel.\n\nIn the open-hearth furnace oxidation is due to air at the surface of the molten metal. This method of steel refining was developed in the mid 1800s, contemporaneous with the industrial revolution. This method requires up to 12 hours—and natural gas or other fuel must be burned to keep the metal liquid. Thus the open hearth wastes large amounts of free energy. The use of fossil fuel does make it possible to recycle as much as 50 percent scrap iron, however, and the longer melting time allows somewhat greater control over the composition of a batch of steel.\n\nDeveloped in the 1950s, the basic oxygen furnace has replaced the open-hearth furnace as the primary steel making method. In this process, pure oxygen is directed onto the surface of molten pig iron in a large crucible. Some of the iron is oxidized to Fe3O4 and Fe2O3, forming an oxidizing slag. The impurities, namely, C, P, Si, Mn, and S, are all oxidized at the same time. Since all these reactions are spontaneous and exothermic, they provide enough heat so that up to 25 percent solid scrap iron may be melted in the crucible without cooling it to the point where solid iron would remain. Oxidation of one batch of pig iron and scrap normally takes slightly more than half an hour. Thus, this method is far quicker than the open-hearth furnace, is three times more efficient.\n\nComputers are now used to interpret spectroscopic analyses of steel in basic oxygen furnaces, indicating in a few minutes what metals must be added to obtain the desired composition. This has largely eliminated the last advantage of the open hearth and speeded up changeovers to basic oxygen. It has also decreased recycling of iron because the latter furnace cannot handle as much scrap. Much recycling of iron is now done in electric-arc furnaces which can melt a charge of 100 percent scrap.\n\nIn addition to the chemical oxidations used in steel making, electrolytic oxidation and reduction is quite important in refining metals. The electrolytic refining of copper, and aluminum production has already been described.\n\n22.07: Corrosion\n\nAn important aspect of the use of some metals, particularly of iron, ",

Coal tar, which is a distillate obtained when heating coal at 1000 oC in the absence of air, is a source of an amazing number of aromatic compounds. Many simple aromatic compounds, some of which includes nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, as well as hydrocarbons are obtained.\n\nSome of the Aromatic Compounds Obtained from Coal Tar\n\nPrior to World War II, coal tar was the only important source of aromatic hydrocarbons, but during the war the demand for benzene and toluene, a precursor to the explosive TNT, rose so sharply that other sources had to be found. Today, most of the benzene and almost all of the toluene produced in the United States are derived from petroleum.

It has been an ongoing movement.” Lupe from UCLA student activist group La Joteria18\n\nAlthough its name, jotería studies, is relatively new, the field has a long interconnected genealogy. The trajectory of jotería thinking, writing, performing, and engaging in activism is woven together like a carefully crafted braid of hair or like sequined fabric, sequins stitched together, creating a luminous tapestry.19 Jotería studies can be traced back to early work of ethnic studies and Chicanx studies and gay, lesbian, gender non-conforming, and trans artists, activists, and scholars of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, including Chicana feminists, third world (women of color) feminists, Chicana lesbian feminists, and trans feministas. (For more on this, review Chapter 5). Collectives of lesbian and queer Chicanas have been at the forefront of these movements and shifts in consciousness. Like Gloria Anzaldua, Osa Hidalgo de La Riva is an important filmmaker and activist who laid the foundation for much of the creative and philosophical thinking. She is shown in Figure 6.2.1. When asked about her participation in the Chicano movement, Hidalgo De La Riva says, “Well, we were all active, as a family. My brother Louis did Chicano murals and he was always painting. When we organized events like a poetry reading or a Chicano art show, we would always have family and a large mix of people.”20 De La Riva’s comment reminds us that joteria were also part of the Chicano movement, even if those voices have often been excluded from the historical record.\n\nJotería studies also has muxerista foundations. According to Anita Tijerina Revilla, a “muxerista is a person whose identity is rooted in a Chicana Latina feminist version for social change, committed to ending all forms of oppression including but not limited to classism, racism, sexism, homophobia, and citizen ism. Its definition is rooted in the scholarship and activism of Chicanos and feminists of color, but it's extended by the work experience and theoretical understandings of the members of Raza Womyn,” an organization at UCLA in the late 1990s.21 Anita Tijerina Revilla, Joanna Nuñez, José Manuel Santillana, and Sergio A. Gonzalez remind us of this concept and its history, expanding it and arguing for a jotería-muxerista approach, a radical queer, gender expansive feminist perspective anchored in multidimensional and intersectional struggle, love, social justice, accountability, friendship, and healing.22 The historical, theoretical, and spiritual connections to women of color feminisms are particularly important to discuss in relation to the liberatory epistemologies that have shaped the critical work we do.

To do so, we discuss the importance of customer engagement, customer lifetime value, ways to measure engagement, consumption communities, and co-creation activities.\n\nUnderstand the concepts of engagement and loyalty, how to calculate customer lifetime value and its importance in marketing strategy, how to measure engagement, and how to create value with consumers.\n\nEngage\n\nA widespread definition of engagement attributed to Forrester is the “creation of deep connections with customers that drive purchase decisions, interaction, and participation, over time creating deep connections with customers that drive purchase decisions, interaction, and participation, over time.” Accordingly, the two objectives of the Engage stage are to (1) foster loyalty, and (2) co-create value with customers.\n\nKey performance indicators at this stage help measure a firm’s success in attaining these objectives and the achievement by consumers of associated goals. KPIs include the number of shares, brand mentions, referrals, repurchases, and reviews, and the ratio of comments on posts, comments on likes, and reviews on sales.\n\nThe Engage stage is central for many reasons. First, recent research shows how loyalty leaders “grow revenues roughly 2.5 times as fast as their industry peers and deliver two to five times the shareholder returns over the next 10 years” (HBR). Working on increasing engagement is thus profitable. There are a few reasons that explain this.\n\nAcquiring customers is much more costly than retaining and selling to existing ones, and repeat consumers tend to spend more than new ones (Forbes). Engaged consumers are also more willing to interact with you, facilitating market research, and leading to groundbreaking insights. This is particularly true since you can develop winning engagement strategies by identifying what makes your loyal customers loyal. Last, engage customers to work on your behalf, co-creating content that, as we’ve seen, is used by other consumers throughout their journey.\n\nTo better understand the value of customers over their lifetime with a company, we turn our attention to the concept of customer lifetime value. We then see two tools that help better understand and measure customer loyalty. We conclude the chapter by examining value co-creation.\n\nCustomer Lifetime Value\n\nCustomer lifetime value (CLV) represents a customer’s profitability over its entire relationship with the business. A straightforward approach to help calculate CLV and understand the concept better is:\n\nCLV=Average profit per sale (AP) *number of repeat transaction in a period (RTP)*retention time(RT)\n\n(Please note that this is a simplistic approach used to understand this concept and not something we would recommend in a real-life setting.)\n\nExample $1$\n\nFor example, le",

                "source_content": "A board’s primary role is a fiduciary one. It is not surprising, therefore, that most board processes are designed with this objective in mind—to ensure management is accountable to the board and the board to shareholders. Recent reforms also reflect this bias toward the fiduciary role of the board. Consider, for example, the focus on greater disclosure, director independence, executive sessions, increased communications with major shareholders, and on separating the offices of chairman and CEO. All these changes are aimed at providing greater transparency and increased accountability. They do not, however, address the deeper issue of how the board can function better as a group.\n\nNo group can operate effectively without a well-defined, shared understanding of its primary role and accountability. The ongoing debate about the fundamental purpose and accountability of the modern corporation has created a problem for boards as a whole, as well as for individual directors—what behaviorists call a heightened sense of role ambiguity and, in some instances, increased role conflict. For example, while recent regulatory reforms promote enhanced transparency and accountability, they also may well increase directors’ anxiety about their ability to effectively carry out their responsibilities to say nothing about their personal exposure to legal and other challenges. If true, the outcome may be opposite of what is intended—a decrease in proactive conduct and more conservative “defensive” behavior on the part of directors, individually and as a group. And while recent reforms may clarify some of the formal rules that govern board composition and operation, little attention has been paid to what impact these changes are likely to have on the unstated or informal rules that govern much of actual board behavior.\n\nFormal Versus Informal Rules\n\nAll group behavior, including that of boards, is governed by formal and informal rules. Formal rules include explicit policies about how often they meet, how they structure their meetings, who participates on what committees, and how issues are decided by discussion and vote. As with many groups, however, board behavior is also governed by a set of powerful unstated informal rules or norms. For example, asking management “tough, penetrating” questions about performance is formally encouraged and seen as part of a director’s duty. At the same time, if a director pursues an issue too long or too vigorously, he or she may be seen to violate any one of a number of unstated rules about what the other directors consider “effective” board membership.For more on formal versus informal rules in the boardroom, see Carter and Lorsch (2004), chap. 8. See also Khurana and Pick (2005), pp. 1259–1285.\n\nThis is one explanation for why so many boardroom votes are unanimous. While it is acceptable to occasionally cast a dissenting vote, if a board member repeatedly votes “against” his or her peers, however, he or she may be asked whether he ",

Sterile technique should always be employed when working with live cell cultures and reagents/media that will be used for such cultures. This technique involves using flame to kill contaminating organisms, and a general mode of operation that minimizes exposure of sterile media and equipment to contaminants.\n\nWhen working with cultures of living organisms, it is extremely important to maintain the environments in which cells are cultured and manipulated as free of other organisms as possible. This requires that exposure of containers of sterilized culture media to outside air should be minimized, and that flame is used to “re-sterilize” container lids and rims. This means passing rims and lids through the flame produced by a Bunsen burner in order to kill microorganisms coming in contact with those surfaces.\n\nSterile technique, in general, is a learned state-of-being, or mantra, where every utilization of any sterile material comes with the caveat of taking every precaution to ensure it remains as free of contaminants as possible for as long as possible. Heat is an excellent means of killing microorganisms, and the Bunsen burner is the sterile technician’s best friend.\n\nA serial dilution is the step-wise dilution of a substance in solution. Usually the dilution factor at each step is constant, resulting in a geometric progression of the concentration in a logarithmic fashion. A ten-fold serial dilution could be 1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M, 0.001 M… Serial dilutions are used to accurately create highly-diluted solutions as well. A culture of microbes can be diluted in the same fashion.

However, genetic diversity is increasingly considered as a component of biodiversity. The area in question could be a habitat, a biome, or the entire biosphere. Species richness is the term that is used to describe the number of species living in a habitat or biome. Species richness varies across the globe (Figure \\(1\\)). One factor in determining species richness is latitude, with the greatest species richness occurring in ecosystems near the equator, which often have warmer temperatures, large amounts of rainfall, and low seasonality. The lowest species richness occurs near the poles, which are much colder, drier, and thus less conducive to life in Geologic time (time since glaciations). The predictability of climate or productivity is also an important factor. Other factors influence species richness as well. For example, the study of island biogeography attempts to explain the relatively high species richness found in certain isolated island chains, including the Galápagos Islands that inspired the young Darwin. Relative species abundance is the number of individuals in a species relative to the total number of individuals in all species within a habitat, ecosystem, or biome. Foundation species often have the highest relative abundance of species. For more on species richness, see The Value of Biodiversity.\n\nKeystone Species\n\nA keystone species is one whose presence is key to maintaining biodiversity within an ecosystem and to upholding an ecological community’s structure. A keystone species has a disproportionate impact on the overall ecosystem, meaning that even a small number of individuals can cause large scale changes. The intertidal sea star, Pisaster ochraceus, of the northwestern United States is a keystone species (Figure \\(2\\)). Studies have shown that when this organism is removed from communities, populations of their natural prey (mussels) increase. The increase in mussel results in a decrease in algae, wihch completely alters species composition and reduces biodiversity. Another keystone species is the banded tetra, a fish in tropical streams, which supplies nearly all of the phosphorus, a necessary inorganic nutrient, to the rest of the community. If these fish were to become extinct, the community would be greatly affected.\n\nInvasive Species\n\nInvasive species are exotic or non-native organisms that, when introduced to an area out of their native range, threaten the ecosystem balance of that habitat. They often increase in numbers and decrease the native s",

In this section we will be concerned with finding the most general solution to such trigonometric equations.\n• 6.2: Numerical Methods in Trigonometry\nWe were able to solve the trigonometric equations in the previous section fairly easily, which in general is not the case. Instead, we have to resort to numerical methods, which provide ways of getting successively better approximations to the actual solution(s) to within any desired degree of accuracy.\n• 6.3: Complex Numbers\nThere is no real number $x$ such that $x^ 2 = −1$. However, it turns out to be useful to invent such a number, called the imaginary unit and denoted by the letter i.\n• 6.4: Polar Coordinates\nSuppose that from the point (1,0) in the xy-coordinate plane we draw a spiral around the origin, such that the distance between any two points separated by $360^\\circ$ along the spiral is always 1, as in Figure 6.4.1. We can not express this spiral as $y = f (x)$ for some function $f$ in Cartesian coordinates, since its graph violates the vertical rule. However, this spiral would be simple to describe using the polar coordinate system.\n• 6.E: Additional Topics (Exercises)\nThese are homework exercises to accompany Corral's \"Elementary Trigonometry\" Textmap. This is a text on elementary trigonometry, designed for students who have completed courses in high-school algebra and geometry. Though designed for college students, it could also be used in high schools. The traditional topics are covered, but a more geometrical approach is taken than usual. Also, some numerical methods (e.g. the secant method for solving trigonometric equations) are discussed.\n\nThumbnail: This spiral would be complicated to quantify in Cartesian system, but is quite simple to describe using the polar coordinate system. \n\n06: Additional Topics \n\nAn equation involving trigonometric functions is called a trigonometric equation. For example, an equation like\n\n$\\tan\\;A ~=~ 0.75 ~, \\nonumber$\n\nwhich we encountered in Chapter 1, is a trigonometric equation. In Chapter 1 we were concerned only with finding a single solution (say, between $0^\\circ$ and $90^\\circ$). In this section we will be concerned with finding the most general solution to such equations.\n\nTo see what that means, take the above equation $\\tan\\;A = 0.75$. Using the $\\fbox{\\(\\tan^{-1}$}\\) calculator button in degree mode, we get $A=36.87^\\circ$. However, we know that the tangent function has period $\\pi$ rad $= 180^\\circ$, i.e. it repeats every $180^\\circ$. Thus, there are many other possible answers for the value of $A$, namely $36.87^\\circ + 180^\\circ$, $36.87^\\circ - 180^\\circ$, $36.87^\\circ + 360^\\circ$, $36.87^\\circ - 360^\\circ$, $36.87^\\circ + 540^\\circ$, etc. We can write this in a more compact form:\n\n$A ~=~ 36.87^\\circ \\;+\\; 180^\\circ k \\quad\\text{for $k=0$, $\\pm\\,1$, $\\pm\\,2$, $...$} \\nonumber$\n\nThis is the m",

The Americas also provided a new arena for intense imperial rivalry as different European nations jockeyed for preeminence in the New World. The religious motives for colonization spurred European expansion as well, and as the Protestant Reformation gained ground beginning in the 1520s, rivalries between Catholic and Protestant Christians spilled over into the Americas.\n\nENGLISH EXPLORATION\n\nDisruptions during the Tudor monarchy—especially the creation of the Protestant Church of England by Henry VIII in the 1530s, the return of the nation to Catholicism under Queen Mary in the 1550s, and the restoration of Protestantism under Queen Elizabeth—left England with little energy for overseas projects. More important, England lacked the financial resources for such endeavors. Nonetheless, English monarchs carefully monitored developments in the new Atlantic World and took steps to assert England’s claim to the Americas. As early as 1497, Henry VII of England had commissioned John Cabot, an Italian mariner, to explore new lands. Cabot sailed from England that year and made landfall somewhere along the North American coastline. For the next century, English fishermen routinely crossed the Atlantic to fish the rich waters off the North American coast. However, English colonization efforts in the 1500s were closer to home, as England devoted its energy to the colonization of Ireland.\n\nQueen Elizabeth favored England’s advance into the Atlantic World, though her main concern was blocking Spain’s effort to eliminate Protestantism. Indeed, England could not commit to large-scale colonization in the Americas as long as Spain appeared ready to invade Ireland or Scotland. Nonetheless, Elizabeth approved of English privateers, sea captains to whom the home government had given permission to raid the enemy at will. These skilled mariners cruised the Caribbean, plundering Spanish ships whenever they could. Each year the English took more than £100,000 from Spain in this way; English privateer Francis Drake first made a name for himself when, in 1573, he looted silver, gold, and pearls worth £40,000.\n\nElizabeth did sanction an early attempt at colonization in 1584, when Sir Walter Raleigh, a favorite of the queen’s, attempted to establish a colony at Roanoke, an island off the coast of present-day North Carolina. The colony was small, consisting of only 117 people, who suffered a poor relationship with the local Indians, the Croatans, and struggled to survive in their new land (Figure 2.3.1). Their governor, John White, returned to England in late 1587 to secure more people and supplies, but events conspired to keep him away from Roanoke for three years. By the time he returned in 1590, the entire colony had vanished. The only trace the colonists left behind was the word Croatoan carved into a fence surrounding the village. Governor White ",

Many of the same people supported another doctrine that had been spread by the Napoleonic wars: liberalism. The ideas of liberalism were based on the Enlightenment concepts of reason, rationality, and progress from the eighteenth century, but as a movement liberalism came of age in the post-Napoleonic period; the word itself was in regular use by 1830.\n\nNineteenth-century liberals were usually educated men and women, including the elites of industry, trade, and the professions as well as the middle classes. They shared the conviction that freedom in all its forms—freedom from the despotic rule of kings, from from the obsolete privilege of nobles, from economic interference and religious intolerance, from occupational restrictions and limitations of speech and assembly—could only improve the quality of society and the well-being of its members.\n\nIn something of a contrast to the abstract nature of national identity among nationalists, liberalism had straightforward concrete beliefs, all of them reflecting not just abstract theories but the concrete examples of the liberal American and French Revolutions of the prior century. Perhaps liberalism’s most fundamental belief was that there should be equality before the law, in stark contrast to the old “feudal” (almost a slur to liberals) order of legally-defined social estates. From that starting point of equality, the very purpose of law to liberals was to protect the rights of each and every citizen rather than enshrine the privileges of a minority.\n\nWhereas “rights” had meant the traditional privileges enjoyed by a given social group or estate in the past, from the king’s exclusive right to hunt game in his forests to the peasants’ right to access the common lands, rights now came to mean a fundamental and universal privilege that was concomitant with citizenship itself. Liberals argued that freedom of speech, of a press free from censorship, and of religious expression were “rights” that should be enjoyed by all. Likewise, most liberals favored the abolition of archaic economic interference from the state, including legal monopolies on trade (e.g. in shipping between colonies) and the monopolies enjoyed by those craft guilds that remained - the “right” was part of the liberal paradigm as well.\n\nJust as had the French revolutionaries in the early phase of the revolution, most liberals early nineteenth-century liberals looked to constitutional monarchy as the most reasonable and stable form of government. Constitutions should be written to guarantee the fundamental rights of the citizenry and to define, and restrict, the power of the king (thus staving off the threat of tyranny).

King William’s War, Queen Anne’s War, and King George’s War originated in Europe; the French and Indian War, on the other hand, began in the colonies two years before it “spread” to Europe and became known as the Seven Years’ War. During most of the eighteenth century before 1763, the British had followed a policy that William Pitt nicknamed “salutary neglect.” This theory was based on the notion that if the colonies were left alone to pursue their own economic interests, they would prosper and thereby ultimately benefit the mother country. This approach to colonial management ended in 1763 with the conclusion of the French and Indian War. Determined to make the colonies defray part of the expenses of the war and of their own domestic needs following the war, the Parliament enacted a series of measures designed, in the words of the colonists, to “raise a revenue.” Colonial opposition to these policies became strident between 1763 and 1775, and the rallying cry “no taxation without representation” underscored the differences in the way the colonies and the mother country looked at taxation, regulation, and control.\n\nThe climax of the protests came in 1773 as tea from the East India Tea Company was dumped into the harbors of ports along the eastern seaboard. The British reacted with the “Intolerable” Acts, to which the colonies responded in spring, 1774, by sending a list of grievances to the king and Parliament. Matters were made worse when George III came to the conclusion late in the year that “blows must be exchanged to determine whether [the American colonies] are to be subject to this country or independent.”\n\nIn May, 1775, a month after the firings at Lexington and Concord, the Second Continental Congress convened to consider the response of George III to the petition submitted in spring, 1774, and ",

For example, an economist might wish to estimate the mean yearly income of workers in a particular industry at $90\\%$ confidence and to within $\\500$. Since sampling costs time, effort, and money, it would be useful to be able to estimate the smallest size sample that is likely to meet these criteria.\n\nEstimating $μ$\n\nThe confidence interval formulas for estimating a population mean $\\mu$ have the form $\\overline{x} \\pm E$. When the population standard deviation $σ$ is known,\n\n$E=\\dfrac{z_{\\alpha/2}σ}{\\sqrt{n}} \\nonumber$\n\nThe number $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is determined by the desired level of confidence. To say that we wish to estimate the mean to within a certain number of units means that we want the margin of error $E$ to be no larger than that number. Thus we obtain the minimum sample size needed by solving the displayed equation for $n$.\n\nMinimum Sample Size for Estimating a Population Mean\n\nThe estimated minimum sample size $n$ needed to estimate a population mean $μ$ to within $E$ units at $100(1−\\alpha)\\%$ confidence is\n\n$n=\\dfrac{(z_{\\alpha/2})^2σ^2}{E^2} \\, \\text{(rounded up)} \\label{estimate}$\n\nTo apply Equation \\ref{estimate}, we must have prior knowledge of the population in order to have an estimate of its standard deviation $σ$. In all the examples and exercises the population standard deviation will be given.\n\nExample $1$\n\nFind the minimum sample size necessary to construct a $99\\%$ confidence interval for $μ$ with a margin of error $E = 0.2$. Assume that the population standard deviation is $σ = 1.3$.\n\nSolution\n\nConfidence level $99\\%$ means that $α=1−0.99=0.01$ so $α/2=0.005$. From the last line of Figure 7.1.6 we obtain $z_{0.005}=2.576$. Thus\n\n$n=\\dfrac{(z_{\\alpha/2})^2σ^2}{E^2} = \\dfrac{(2.576)^2(1.3)^2}{(0.2)^2}=280.361536 \\nonumber$\n\nwhich we round up to $281$, since it is impossible to take a fractional observation.\n\nExample $2$\n\nAn economist wishes to estimate, with a $95\\%$ confidence interval, the yearly income of welders with at least five years experience to within $\\1,000$. He estimates that the range of incomes is no more than $\\24,000$, so using the Empirical Rule he estimates the population standard deviation to be about one-sixth as much, or about $\\4,000$. Find the estimated minimum sample size required.\n\nSolution\n\nConfidence level $95\\%$ means that $α=1−0.95=0.05$ so $α/2=0.025$. From the last line of Figure 7.1.6 we obtain $z_{0.025}=1.960$.\n\nTo say that the estimate is to be “to within $\\1,000$” means that $E = 1000$. Thus\n\n$n=\\dfrac{(z_{\\alpha/2})^2σ^2}{E^2} = \\dfrac{(1.960)^2(4000)^2}{(1000)^2}=61.4656 \\nonumber$\n\nwhich we round up to $62$.\n\nEstimating $p$\n\nThe confidence interval formula for estimating a population proportion $p$ is $\\hat{",

Such operations include console output, keyboard input, file services (open, read, write, close, etc.), obtaining the time or date, requesting memory allocation, and many others.\n\nAccessing system services is how the application requests that the operating system perform some specific operation (on behalf of the process). More specifically, the system call is the interface between an executing process and the operating system.\n\nThis section provides an explanation of how to use some basic system service calls. More information on additional system service calls is located in Appendix C, System Service Calls. \n\n13: System Services \n\nA system service call is logically similar to calling a function, where the function code is located within the operating system. The function may require privileges to operate which is why control must be transferred to the operating system.\n\nWhen calling system services, arguments are placed in the standard argument registers. System services do not typically use stack-based arguments. This limits the arguments of a system services to six (6), which does not present a significant limitation.\n\nTo call a system service, the first step is to determine which system service is desired. There are many system services (see Appendix C). The general process is that the system service call code is placed in the rax register. The call code is a number that has been assigned for the specific system service being requested. These are assigned as part of the operating system and cannot be changed by application programs. To simplify the process, this text will define a very small subset of system service call codes to a set of constants. For this text, and the associated examples, the subset of system call code constants are defined and shown in the source file to help provide complete clarity for new assembly language programmers. For more experienced programmers, typically developing larger or more complex programs, a complete list of constants is in a file and included into the source file.\n\nIf any are needed, the arguments for system services are placed in the rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, and r9 registers (in that order). The following table shows the argument locations which are consistent with the standard calling convention.\n\nRegister\n\nUsage\n\nrax\n\nCall code (see table)\n\nrdi\n\n1st argument (if needed)\n\nrsi\n\n2nd argument (if needed)\n\nrdx\n\n3rd argument (if needed)\n\nr10\n\n4th argument (if needed)\n\nr8\n\n5th argument (if needed)\n\nr9\n\n6th argument (if needed)\n\nThis is very similar to the standard calling convention for function calls, however the 4th argument, if needed, uses the r10 register.\n\nEach system call will use a different number of arguments (from none up to 6). However, the system service call code is always required.\n\nAfter the call code and any arguments are set, the syscall instruction is executed. The syscall instruction will pau",

Explain the differences between a defined benefit plan and a defined contribution pension plan.\n3. Summarize the structure and purpose of Social Security.\n4. State the difference between a Traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.\n5. Identify retirement plans for the self-employed.\n\nWhile knowing the numbers clarifies the picture of your needs, you must reconcile that picture with the realities that you face now. How will you be able to afford to save what you need for retirement?\n\nThere are several savings plans structured to help you save—some offer tax advantages, some don’t—but first you need to make a commitment to save.\n\nSaving means not spending a portion of your disposable income. It means delaying gratification or putting off until tomorrow what you could have today. That is often difficult, as you have many demands on your disposable income. You must weigh the benefit of fulfilling those demands with the cost of not saving for retirement, even though benefit in the present is much easier to credit than benefit in the future. Once you resolve to save, however, employer, government, and individual retirement plans are there to help you.\n\nEmployer Retirement Accounts\n\nEmployers may sponsor pension or retirement plans for their employees as part of the employees’ total compensation. There are two kinds of employer-sponsored plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.\n\nA defined benefit plan is a retirement plan, sometimes called a pension plan, funded by the employer, who promises the employee a specific benefit upon retirement. The employer can be a corporation, labor union, government, or other organization that establishes a retirement plan for its employees. In addition to (or instead of) a defined benefit plan, an employer may also offer a profit-sharing plan, a stock bonus plan, an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), a thrift plan, or other plan. Each type of plans has advantages and disadvantages for employers and employees, but all are designed to give employees a way to save for the future and employers a way to attract and keep employees.\n\nThe payout for a defined benefit plan is usually an annual or monthly payment for the remainder of the employee’s life. In some defined benefit plans, there is also a spousal or survivor’s benefit. The amount of the benefit is determined by your wages and length of service with the company.\n\nMany defined benefit plans are structured with a vesting option that limits your claim on the retirement fund until you have been with the company for a certain length of time. For example, Paul’s employer has a defined benefit plan that provides for Paul to be 50 percent vested after five years and fully vested after seven years. If Paul were to leave the company before he had worked there for five years, none of his retirement fund would be in his account. If he left after six years, half his fund",

Legal efforts to reduce the occurrence of war, restrict behaviour in time of war, and place limits on certain weapons of armed conflict are central to promoting human security. Further, the development of international human rights since World War II is reviewed as well as the new concept of Responsibility to Protect (R2P), which allows the international community to intervene on behalf of endangered citizens of other countries. Central to the empowerment of human security regimes are the international organizations that populate the international arena. Chief among those considered in this chapter are the United Nations Security Council, the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, and temporary war crimes tribunals. \n\n18: Empowering International Human Security Regimes \n\nA central and defining feature of international relations is the condition of anarchy, a term that means the lack of world government. Without an overarching supranational force to constrain the behaviour of states and individuals, the anarchic system is inherently conflict prone. Since reordering the international system in an effort to avoid anarchy is highly unlikely, states promote order and clarity in world politics by developing and maintaining rules of behaviour. International laws have been developed in virtually every area of international relations, ranging from trade to diplomatic immunity, air space to the law of the sea. An area of consistent concern and of utmost importance to countries is war. As a result, a significant amount of time and energy have been devoted to drafting international laws that regulate armed conflict. This chapter seeks to explain efforts by the international community to eliminate, mitigate, or reduce the destructive behaviour of states towards one another and towards their own citizens through the adoption and a",

The events and people we write about did not occur in isolation but in dialogue with a myriad of other people and events. In fact, at any given moment millions of people are all talking at once. As historians we try to isolate one conversation and to explore it, but the trick is then how to put that conversation in a context which makes evident its dialogue with so many others—how to make this one lyric stand alone and at the same time be in connection with all the other lyrics being sung.”\n\n—Elsa Barkley Brown, “’What has happened here,’” pp. 297-298.\n\nFeminist historian Elsa Barkley Brown reminds us that social movements and identities are not separate from each other, as we often imagine they are in contemporary society. She argues that we must have a relational understanding of social movements and identities within and between social movements—an understanding of the ways in which privilege and oppression are linked and how the stories of people of color and feminists fighting for justice have been historically linked through overlapping and sometimes conflicting social movements. In this chapter, we use a relational lens to discuss and make sense of feminist movements, beginning in the 19th Century up to the present time. Although we use the terms “first wave,” “second wave,” and “third wave,” characterizing feminist resistance in these “waves” is problematic, as it figures distinct “waves” of activism as prioritizing distinct issues in each time period, obscuring histories of feminist organizing in locations and around issues not discussed in the dominant “waves” narratives. Indeed, these “waves” are not mutually exclusive or totally separate from each other. In fact, they inform each other, not only in the way that contemporary feminist work has in many ways been made possible by earlier feminist activism, but also in the way that contemporary feminist activism informs the way we think of past feminist activism and feminisms. Nonetheless, understanding that the “wave” language has historical meaning, we use it throughout this section. Relatedly, although a focus on prominent leaders and events can obscure the many people and actions involved in everyday resistance and community organizing, we focus on the most well known figures, political events, and social movements, understanding that doing so advances one particular lens of history.\n\nAdditionally, feminist movements have generated, made possible, and nurtured feminist theories and feminist academic knowledge. In this way, feminist movements are fantastic examples of praxis—that is, they use critical reflection about the world to change ",

Some items are more costly than others, but most establishments will have a range of prices that all the menu items fit into. Consequently, it is important to balance the menu so that the low and high food cost items work together to help you reach your target food cost. This process is called menu engineering. Menu engineering means balancing the high and low food cost items; it also includes strategically featuring or promoting items to help reach your targets.\n\nCalculating Menu Item Costs\n\nThe cost per portion derived from yield tests done on the main ingredient of a menu item usually represents the greatest part of the cost of preparing the item (see the section above on yield tests for more information).\n\nHowever, of equal importance is the portion cost factor. For example, the portion cost factor can be used to determine the cost of a portion of the main ingredient regardless of the price of the meat (which is often the main cost factor) charged by the supplier as long as the restaurant’s preparation of the meat remains unchanged. The cost per portion is determined by multiplying the portion cost factor by the packing house’s price per kilogram (or pound).\n\nQuite often the cost per portion of the main ingredient is used by itself to determine the selling price of a menu item. This works well with items on an à la carte menu as the basic main ingredient (such as a steak) is sold by itself and traditional add-ons (such as a baked potato and other vegetables) are sold separately.\n\nAs discussed earlier in this book, in many cases, some of the components will be the same, so a basic plate cost can be used to add to the cost of the main protein to get a total cost for the dish.\n\nIn dishes where the main ingredients are not sold as entities but as part of a prepared dish, the cost of all the items in the recipe must be determined to find an accurate portion cost price. In this case, a recipe detail and cost sheet is used to determine the cost price of menu items.

They allow more movement than fibrous joints but less than synovial joints.\n• gomphosis joints: Joints of very limited mobility. These are found at the articulation\nbetween teeth and the sockets of maxilla or mandible (dental-alveolar joint).\n\nJoints or articulations (connections between bones) can be classified in a number of ways. The primary classifications are structural and functional. Functional classification is based on the type and degree of movement permitted.\n\nTypes of Synovial Joints.jpg: Image of a skeleton and skematics of the different classes of synovial joints.\n\nThree Categories of Functional Joints\n\n• Synarthrosis: These types of joints are immobile or allow limited mobility. This category includes fibrous joints such as suture joints (found in the cranium) and gomphosis joints (found between teeth and sockets of the maxilla and mandible).\n• Amphiarthrosis: These joints allow a small amount of mobility. Most joints in this category\ninclude cartilaginous joints such as those found between vertebrae and the pubic symphysis.\n• Diarthrosis: These are the freely-movable synovial joints. Synovial joints are further classified based on the different types of movement they provide, including:\n• Plane joint\n• Ball and socket joint\n• Hinge joint\n• Pivot joint\n• Condyloid joint\n• Saddle joint\n\nMovement of Synovial Joints\n\nJoints can also be classified by the number of axes of movement they permit:\n\n• Nonaxial (gliding): Found between the proximal ends of the ulna and radius.\n• Monoaxial (uniaxial): Movement occurs in one plane. An example is the elbow joint.\n• Biaxial: Movement can occur in two planes. An example is the wrist.\n• Multiaxial: Includes the ball and socket joints. An example is the hip joint.\n\nThe movements possible with synovial joints are:\n\n• Abduction: movement away from the body’s midline\n• Adduction: movement toward the body’s midline\n• Extension: straightening limbs at a joint\n• Flexion: bending the limbs at a joint\n• Rotation: a circular movement around a fixed point\n\nLICENSES AND ATTRIBUTIONS\n\nCC LICENSED CONTENT, SHARED PREVIOUSLY\n\nCC LICENSED CONTENT, SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTION\n\n• Joint.

However, he was not interested in mirroring polite parlor conversations and middle class promenades in the Bois de Boulogne (Paris’ Central Park). Rather, Manet invented subjects that set the Parisians’ teeth on edge.\n\nIn 1865, Manet submitted his risqué painting of a courtesan greeting her client (in this case, you), Olympia, of 1863, to the French Salon. The jury for the 1865 Salon accepted this painting despite their disapproval of the subject matter, because two years earlier, Manet’s Luncheon on the Grass created such a stir when it was rejected from the Salon. (It was instead exhibited in Emperor Napoleon III’s conciliatory exhibition—the Salon des Réfusés, or the Exhibition of the Refused. Crowds came to the Salon des Réfusés specifically to laugh and jeer at what they considered Manet’s folly.)\n\nSomehow they were afraid another rejection would seem like a personal attack on Manet himself. The reasoning was odd, but the result was the same—Olympia became infamous and the painting had to be hung very high to protect it from physical attacks.\n\nManet was a Realist, but sometimes his “real” situations shocked and rocked the Parisi",

Compare $2x^2 −7x−15$ with $ax^2 + bx + c$ and identify $a = 2$, $b = −7$, and $c = −15$. Note that the leading coeﬃcient is $a = 2$, so this case is diﬀerent from all of the cases discussed in Section 6.3.\n2. Calculate $ac$. Note that $ac = (2)(−15)$, so $ac = −30$.\n3. List all integer pairs whose product is $ac =−30$. $\\begin{array}{ll}{1,-30} & {-1,30} \\ {2,-15} & {-2,15} \\ {3,-10} & {-3,10} \\ {5,-6} & {-5,6}\\end{array} \\nonumber$\n4. Circle the ordered pair whose sum is $b =−7$.$\\begin{array}{cc}{1,-30} & {-1,30} \\ {2,-15} & {-2,15} \\ {\\color {Red}3,-10} & {-3,10} \\ {5,-6} & {-5,6}\\end{array} \\nonumber$\n5. Note that if we “drop in place” our circled ordered pair, $(x+3)(x-10) \\neq 2x^2-7x-15$. Right oﬀ the bat, the product of the terms in the “First” position does not equal $2x^2$. Instead, we break up the middle term of $2x^2 −7x−15$ into a sum of like terms using our circled pair of integers $3$ and $−10$. $2x^2{\\color {Red}-7x}-15 = 2x^2{\\color {Red}+3x-10x}-15 \\nonumber$Now we factor by grouping. Factor $x$ out of the ﬁrst two terms and $−5$ out of the second two terms.$= x(2x + 3)−5(2x + 3) \\nonumber$Now we can factor out (2x + 3).$=(x−5)(2x + 3) \\nonumber$\n6. Use the FOIL shortcut to mentally check your answer. To multiply $(x−5)(2x + 3)$, use these steps:\n• Multiply the terms in the “First” positions: $2x^2$.\n• Multiply the terms in the “Outer” and “Inner” positions and combine the results mentally: $3x−10x = −7x$.\n• Multiply the terms in the “Last” positions: $−15$. That is:$(x-5)(2x+3)=\\begin{array}{ccccccc} \\color {Red}F & & \\color {Red}O & & \\color {Red}I & & \\color {Red}L \\ 2x^2&+&3x&-&10x&-&15 \\end{array} \\nonumber$\n\nCombining like terms, $(x − 5)(2x + 3) = 2x^2 − 7x − 15$, which is the original trinomial, so our solution checks. Note that if you combine the “Outer” and “Inner” products mentally, the check goes even faster.\n\nExercise $1$\n\nFactor: $3x^2 + 13x + 14$\n\nAnswer\n\n$(x + 2)(3x + 7)$\n\nSpeeding Things Up a Bit\n\nSome readers might already be asking “Do I really have to list all of those ordered pairs if I already see the pair I need?” The answer is “No!” If you see the pair you need, use it to break up the middle term of the trinomial as a sum of like terms.\n\nExample $2$\n\nFactor: $3x^2 −7x−6$.\n\nSolution\n\nCompare $3x^2−7x−6$ with $ax^2+bx+c$ and note that $a = 3$, $b =−7$, and $c = −6$. Calculate $ac = (3)(−6)$, so $ac = −18$. Now can you think of an integer pair whose product is $ac = −18$ and whose sum is $b = −7$? For some, the pair just pops into their head: $2$",

The existence of the atomic spectra supports Bohr's model.\n• 9.5: The Quantum-Mechanical Model- Atoms with Orbitals\nQuantum mechanics involves the study of material at the atomic level.

Atoms must be close together to form chemical bonds. This simple premise is the basis for a very powerful theory that explains many observations regarding chemical kinetics, including factors affecting reaction rates. Collision theory is based on the following postulates:\n\nPostulates of Collision theory\n1. The rate of a reaction is proportional to the rate of reactant collisions: $\\mathrm{reaction\\: rate ∝ \\dfrac{\\#\\,collisions}{time}} \\nonumber$\n2. The reacting species must collide in an orientation that allows contact between the atoms that will become bonded together in the product.\n3. The collision must occur with adequate energy to permit mutual penetration of the reacting species’ valence shells so that the electrons can rearrange and form new bonds (and new chemical species).\n\nWe can see the importance of the two physical factors noted in postulates 2 and 3, the orientation and energy of collisions, when we consider the reaction of carbon monoxide with oxygen:\n\n$\\ce{2CO}(g)+\\ce{O2}(g)⟶\\ce{2CO2}(g) \\nonumber$\n\nCarbon monoxide is a pollutant produced by the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. To reduce this pollutant, automobiles have catalytic converters that use a catalyst to carry out this reaction. It is also a side reaction of the combustion of gunpowder that results in muzzle flash for many firearms. If carbon monoxide and oxygen are present in sufficient quantity, the reaction is spontaneous at high temperature and pressure.\n\nThe first step in the gas-phase reaction between carbon monoxide and oxygen is a collision between the two molecules:\n\n$\\ce{CO}(g)+\\ce{O2}(g)⟶\\ce{CO2}(g)+\\ce{O}(g) \\nonumber$\n\nAlthough there are many different possible orientations the two molecules can have relative to each other, consider the two presented in Figure $1$.

In the second case, the carbon side of the carbon monoxide molecule collides with the oxygen molecule. The second case is clearly more likely to result in the formation of carbon dioxide, which has a central carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms $\\ce{(O=C=O)}$.

While doing this, we will identify areas of concern for psychologists focused on the treatment of mental disorders.\n\nBrain Structure and Chemistry\n\nCommunication in the Nervous System\n\nTo really understand brain structure and chemistry, it is a good idea to understand how communication occurs within the nervous system. Simply:\n\n1. Receptor cells in each of the five sensory systems detect energy.\n2. This information is passed to the nervous system due to the process of transduction and through sensory or afferent neurons, which are part of the peripheral nervous system.\n3. The information is received by brain structures (central nervous system) and perception occurs.\n4. Once the information has been interpreted, commands are sent out, telling the body how to respond, also via the peripheral nervous system.\n\nPlease note that we will not cover this process in full, but just the parts relevant to our topic of psychopathology.\n\nThe Nervous System\n\nThe nervous system consists of two main parts – the central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system(CNS) is the control center for the nervous system which receives, processes, interprets, and stores incoming sensory information. It consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of everything outside the brain and spinal cord. It handles the CNS’s input and output and divides into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system allows for voluntary movement by controlling the skeletal muscles and it carries sensory information to the CNS. The autonomic nervous system regulates the functioning of blood vessels, glands, and internal organs such as the bladder, stomach, and heart. It consists of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is involved when a person is intensely aroused. It provides the strength to fight back or to flee (fight-or-flight response). Eventually, the response brought about by the sympathetic n",

For example, we may want to know if a potential drug is effective in treating a disease. Since it is not feasible or ethical to distribute an experimental drug to the entire population, we instead must study a small subset of the population called a sample. We then analyze the sample and make an inference about the population based on the sample. Using probability theory and the Central Limit Theorem, we can then measure the reliability of the inference.\n\nExample: Home value appraisal\n\nLupe is trying to sell her house and needs to determine the market value of the home. The population in this example would be all the homes that are similar to hers in the neighborhood.\n\nLupe’s realtor chooses for the sample nine recent homes in this neighborhood that sold in the last six months. The realtor then adjusts some of the sales prices to account for differences among Lupe’s home and the sold homes.\n\nNext the realtor takes the mean of the adjusted sample and recommends to Lupe a market value for Lupe’s home of \\$450,000. The realtor has made an inference about the mean value of the population.\n\nTo measure the reliability of the inference, the realtor should look at factors such as: the small sample size, changes in values of homes over the last six months, or the fact that Lupe’s home is not exactly like the sampled homes.\n\n9.02: Point Estimation\n\nThe example in 9.1 is an example of Estimation, a branch of Inferential Statistics in which sample statistics are used to estimate the values of a population parameter. Lupe’s realtor was trying to estimate the population mean ($\\mu$) based on the sample mean ($\\overline{X}$).\n\n9.03: Confidence Intervals\n\nUsing probability and the Central Limit Theorem, we can design an Interval Estimate called a Confidence Interval which has a known probability (Level of Confidence) of capturing the true population parameter.\n\nConfidence Interval for Population Mean\n\nTo find a confidence interval for the population mean ($\\mu$) when the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$)is known, and n is sufficiently large, we can use the Standard Normal Distribution probability distribution function to calculate the critical values for the Level of Confidence:\n\nExample: Students working\n\nThe Dean wants to estimate the mean number of hours that students worked per week.  A sample of 49 students showed a mean of 24 hours with a standard deviation of 4 hours. The point estimate is 24 hours (sample mean). What is the 95% confidence interval for the average number of hours worked per week by the students?\n\nSolution\n\n$24 \\pm \\dfrac{1.96 \\cdot 4}{\\sqrt{49}}=24 \\pm 1.12=(22.88,25.12) \\text{ hours per week} \\nonumber$\n\nThe margin of error for the confidence interval is 1.12 hours. We can say with 95% confidence that the mean number of hours worked by students is between 22.88 and 25.12 hours per week.\n\nIf the level of confidence is increased",

In addition, inventory and related cost of goods sold are valued using standard cost information, which simplifies the bookkeeping process.\n\nRecording Direct Materials Transactions\n\nQuestion: In Figure 10.4 \"Direct Materials Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream\", we calculated two variances for direct materials at Jerry’s Ice Cream: materials price variance and materials quantity variance. How are these variances recorded for transactions related to direct materials?\n\nAnswer\n\nTwo journal entries are needed to record direct materials transactions that include these variances. An example of each is shown next. (Typically, many more journal entries would be made throughout the year for direct materials. For the purposes of this example, we will make one journal entry for each variance to summarize the activity for the year.)\n\n• Materials Price Variance\n\nThe entry to record the purchase of direct materials and related price variance shown in Figure 10.4 \"Direct Materials Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream\" is\n\nNotice that the raw materials inventory account contains the actual quantity of direct materials purchased at the standard price. Accounts payable reflects the actual cost, and the materials price variance account shows the unfavorable variance. Unfavorable variances are recorded as debits and favorable variances are recorded as credits. Variance accounts are temporary accounts that are closed out at the end of the financial reporting period. We show the process of closing out variance accounts at the end of this appendix.\n\n• Materials Quantity Variance\n\nThe entry to record the use of direct materials in production and related quantity variance shown in Figure 10.4 \"Direct Materials Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream\" is\n\nWork-in-process inventory reflects the standard quantity of direct materials allowed at the standard price. The reduction in raw materials inventory reflects the actual quantity used at the standard price, and the materials quantity variance account shows the favorable variance.\n\n• Recording Direct Labor Transactions\n\nQuestion: In Figure 10.6 \"Direct Labor Variance Analysis for Jerry’s Ice Cream\", we calculated two variances for direct labor at Jerry’s Ice Cream: labor rate variance and labor efficiency variance. How are these variances recorded for transactions related to direct labor?\n\nAnswer\n\nBecause labor is not inventoried for later use like materials, only one journal entry is needed to record direct labor transactions that include these variances. (Again, many more journal entries w",

Such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as homologous structures; they stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds have homologous structures.\n\nNotice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. The more complex the feature, the more probable that any overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two people from different countries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared knowledge. That outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two people both invented a hammer, it would be reasonable to conclude that both could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same relationship between complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms.\n\nMisleading Appearances\n\nSome organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference to make them look quite different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very similar. This usually happens because both organisms developed common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions. When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is called an analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different. These are called analogous structures.\n\nSimilar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous structures share a similar embryonic origin; analogous organs have a similar function. For example, the bones in the front flipper of a whale are homologous to the bones in the human arm. These structures are not analogous. The wings of a butterfly and the wings of a bird are analogous, but not homologous. Some structures are both analogous and homologous: the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are both homologous and analogous. Scientists must determine which type of similarity a feature exhibits to decipher the phylogeny of the organisms being studied.\n\nMolecular Comparisons\n\nWith the advancement of DNA technology, the area of molecular systematics, which describes the use of information on the molecular level including DNA analysis, has blossomed. New computer programs not only confirm many earlier classified organisms, but also uncover previously-made errors. As with physical characteristics, even the DNA sequence can be tricky to read in some cases. For some situations, two very closely-re",

                "source_content": "The Nature of Mass Spectra\n\nA mass spectrum will usually be presented as a vertical bar graph, in which each bar represents an ion having a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and the length of the bar indicates the relative abundance of the ion. The most intense ion is assigned an abundance of 100, and it is referred to as the base peak. Most of the ions formed in a mass spectrometer have a single charge, so the m/z value is equivalent to mass itself. Modern mass spectrometers easily distinguish (resolve) ions differing by only a single atomic mass unit, and thus provide completely accurate values for the molecular mass of a compound. The highest-mass ion in a spectrum is normally considered to be the molecular ion, and lower-mass ions are fragments from the molecular ion, assuming the sample is a single pure compound.\n\nAtomic mass is given in terms of the unified atomic mass unit (symbol: μ) or dalton (symbol: Da). In recent years there has been a gradual change towards using the dalton in preference to the unified atomic mass unit. The dalton is classified as a \"non-SI unit whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally\". It is defined as one twelfth of the rest mass of an unbound atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state, and has a value of 1.660538782(83)x10-27 kg.\n\nThe following diagram displays the mass spectra of three simple gaseous compounds, carbon dioxide, propane and cyclopropane. The molecules of these compounds are similar in size, CO2 and C3H8 both have a nominal mass of 44 Da, and C3H6 has a mass of 42 Da. The molecular ion is the strongest ion in the spectra of CO2 and C3H6, and it is moderately strong in propane. The unit mass resolution is readily apparent in these spectra (note the separation of ions having m/z=39, 40, 41 and 42 in the cyclopropane spectrum). Even though these compounds are very similar in size, it is a simple matter to identify them from their individual mass spectra. By clicking on each spectrum in turn, a partial fragmentation analysis and peak assignment will be displayed. Even with simple compounds like these, it should be noted that it is rarely possible to explain the origin of all the fragment ions in a spectrum. Also, the structure of most fragment ions is seldom known with certainty.\n\nSince a molecule of carbon dioxide is composed of only three atoms, its mass spectrum is very simple. The molecular ion is also the base peak, and the only fragment ions are CO (m/z=28) and O (m/z=16). The molecular ion of propane also has m/z=44, but it is not the most abundant ion in the spectrum. Cleavage of a carbon-carbon bond gives methyl and ethyl fragments, one of which is a carbocation and the other a radical. Both distributions are observed, but the larger ethyl cation (m/z=29) is the most abundant, possibly because its size affords greater charge dispersal. A similar bond cleavage in cyclopropane does not give two fragments, so the molecular ion is stronger than in propane, and i",

Explain the need for an adjusting entry in the reporting of prepaid expenses and be able to prepare that adjustment.\n2. Explain the need for an adjusting entry in the reporting of accrued revenue and be able to prepare that adjustment.\n3. Describe the difficulty of determining when the earning process for revenue is substantially complete and discuss possible resolutions.\n\nQuestion: The second adjustment to be considered here involves the handling ofprepaid expenses. In the transactions that were recorded in the previous chapter, Journal Entry 10 reported a \\$4,000 payment made in advance for four months of rent to use a building. An asset—prepaid rent—was recorded through the normal accounting process. This account is listed on the trial balance in Figure 5.1 “Updated Trial Balance”. Why might a year-end adjusting entry be needed in connection with a prepaid expense?\n\nAnswer: During these four months, the Lawndale Company will use the rented facility to help generate revenue. Over that time, the future economic benefit established by the payment gradually becomes a past benefit. The asset literally changes into an expense day by day. For illustrative purposes, assume that one month has now passed since the original payment. This month of benefit provided by the rent (\\$1,000 or \\$4,000/four months) no longer exists; it has been consumed.\n\nAs a preliminary step in preparing financial statements, an adjusting entry is needed to reclassify \\$1,000 from the asset into an expense account. This adjustment leaves \\$3,000 in the asset (for the remaining three months of rent on the building) while \\$1,000 is now reported as an expense (for the previous one month of rent).\n\nThe basic purpose of adjusting entries is to take whatever amounts reside in the ledger and align them with the requirements of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). For this illustration, the original \\$4,000 payment was classified as a prepaid rent and the adjustment above was created in response to that initial entry.\n\nIn recording transactions, some accounting systems mechanically handle events in a different manner than others. Thus, construction of an adjusting entry always depends on the recording that previously took place. To illustrate, assume that when this \\$4,000 payment was made, the company’s computer program had been designed to enter a debit to rent expense rather than to prepaid rent. All money spent for rent was automatically recorded as rent expense. This initial accounting has no impact on the final figures to be reported but does alter the adjustment process.\n\nAn adjusting entry still needs to be prepared so that the expense appearing on the income statement is \\$1,000 (for the past one month) while the asset on the balance sheet is shown as \\$3,000 (for the next three months). If the entire cost of \\$4,000 is in rent expense, the fol",

This same principle applies to HTML containers. In HTML, there is a generic type of container element, called a Div, that we can use to surround our content. It has an opening <div> tag before the content, and a closing </div> tag at the end of the content. When we specify a width in percent (%) for a container, its content will reflow as a browser window is scaled down. In the past, people used tables to layout just about everything on a web page. While this works for sighted users, it causes problems for people using screen readers. Using tables for layout should be reserved for tabular data or information that has a two-way relationship, such as found in rubrics or course schedules. Sometimes, tables can be used for layout if the content within is read in a logical order. A screen reader reads linearly, from top to bottom, line by line, in the order that content appears in the HTML. This holds true for both the content in the HTML code and content within a table. If the default language is read from left to right, the screen reader also reads from left to right, line by line, from top to bottom.\n\nBelow I’ll give you some code to create fluid content containers. Their basic structure can be re-used and you can put your choice of text, images or media within.\n\nSingle container with rounded corners\n\nHere’s a single container with rounded corners in which you can write whatever you would like. This box will respond to your screen size so that the text reflows and remains visible without scrolling, until Blackboard’s content area hits its minimum width of 1150 pixels. It doesn’t use an image in its background, so it is light weight in terms of downloading content. Its only limitation is set within Blackboard Learn’s minimum width size for the parent element (the content area).\n\nThe code that you would enter into the HTML Code View is:\n\n<div style=”border-radius: 25 px; background-color: #006a4d; color: # fff; padding: 1.5em; margin:1.5em; font-size: 1 em; font-weigh",

                "source_content": "Reductive Elimination Reactions\n\nReductive elimination is the microscopic reverse of oxidative addition. The reductive elimination can only occur when the two ligands to be eliminated are in cis-position.\n\nFor instance the previously discussed oxidative cis-addition of H2 to the iridium complex is reversible, and the reverse is called the reductive elimination (Fig. \\(1\\)). The cis-orientation of the two hydrido ligands is necessary to form an H-H bond. The reaction can be thought of going along a reaction path in which the Ir-H bonds become gradually larger and and the H-H distance gradually smaller until the H2 molecule is eliminated from the complex.\n\nDuring reductive elimination, the electrons in the M–X bond head toward ligand Y, and the electrons in M–Y head to the metal. The eliminating ligands are always X-type! On the whole, the oxidation state of the metal decreases by two units, two new open coordination sites become available, and an X–Y bond forms. What does the change in oxidation state suggest about changes in electron density at the metal? As suggested by the name “reductive,” the metal gains electrons. The ligands lose electrons as the new X–Y bond cannot possibly be polarized to both X and Y, as the original M–X and M–Y bonds were. Using these ideas, you may already be thinking about reactivity trends in reductive elimination…hold that thought.\n\nIt’s been observed in a number of cases that a ligand dissociates from octahedral complexes before concerted reductive elimination occurs. Presumably, dissociation to form a distorted TBP geometry brings the eliminating groups closer to one another to facilitate elimination.\n\nSquare planar complexes may either take on an additional fifth ligand or lose a ligand to form an odd-coordinate complex before reductive elimination. Direct reductive elimination without dissociation or association is possible, too.\n\nReactivity trends in reductive elimination are opposite those of oxidative addition. More electron-rich ligands bearing electron-donating groups react more rapidly, since the ligands lose electron density as the reaction proceeds. More electron-poor metal centers—bearing π-acidic ligands and/or ligands with electron-withdrawing groups—react more rapidly, since the metal center gains electrons. Sterically bulky ancillary ligands promote reductive elimination since the release of X and Y can “ease” steric strain in the starting complex. Steric hindrance helps explain, for example, why coordination of a fifth ligand to a square planar complex promotes reductive elimination even though coordination increases electron density at the metal center. A second example: trends in rates of reductive eliminations of alkanes parallel the steric demands of the eliminating ligands: C–C > C–H > H–H.\n\nMechanistic trends for reductive elimination actually parallel trends in mechanisms of oxidative addition, since these two reactions are the microscopic reverse of one another.

As he passed through several Swahili city-states on the East African coast, Barbosa noted the brisk trade and the riches of these African settlements where he saw a “great plenty of gold” that would serve Portuguese interests.1 In his mind, God had destined these stashes of gold for the Portuguese and the local Swahili rulers acted unwisely and arrogantly to defend themselves. In the conflict that followed, the Portuguese plundered the Swahili city-states, burning buildings and enslaving African men and women. Barbosa boasted that when the Portuguese looted the settlements, they slaughtered many people and took a “great spoil of gold and silver and goods.”2 Barbosa’s description highlights the violence of Portuguese conquest and also his expectation that he and his countrymen were creating a new Portuguese empire that would make a lasting mark in East Africa and the wider Indian Ocean world. However, less than 100 years later, Portuguese influences were noticeably absent in most of East Africa and their power in the Indian Ocean was fading rapidly. Barbosa, himself, had traveled with his brother-in-law, Ferdinand Magellan, and met an untimely end (in his early 40s) in the Philippines.\n\nWriting about the coast of East A",

This requires the use of multivariate models. The situation is more complex than the univariate case – but not much! In this section I will derive the expectation for a set of (potentially correlated) traits evolving together under a multivariate Brownian motion model.\n\nCharacter values across species can covary because of phylogenetic relationships, because different characters tend to evolve together, or both. Fortunately, we can generalize the model described above to deal with both of these types of covariation. To do this, we must combine two variance-covariance matrices. The first one, C, we have already seen; it describes the variances and covariances across species for single traits due to shared evolutionary history along the branches of a phylogentic tree. The second variance-covariance matrix, which we can call R, describes the variances and covariances across traits due to their tendencies to evolve together. For example, if a species of lizard gets larger due to the action of natural selection, then many of its other traits, like head and limb size, will get larger too due to allometry. The diagonal entries of the matrix R will provide our estimates of σi2, the net rate of evolution, for each trait, while off-diagonal elements, σij, represent evolutionary covariances between pairs of traits. We will denote number of species as n and the number of traits as m, so that C is n × n and R is m × m.\n\nOur multivariate model of evolution has parameters that can be described by an m × 1 vector, a, containing the starting values for each trait – $\\bar{z}_1(0)$, $\\bar{z}_2(0)$, and so on, up to $\\bar{z}_m(0)$, and an m × m matrix, R, described above. This model has m parameters for a and m ⋅ (m + 1)/2 parameters for R, for a total of m ⋅ (m + 3)/2 parameters.\n\nUnder our multivariate Brownian motion model, the joint distribution of all traits across all species still follows a multivariate normal distribution. We find the variance-covariance matrix that describes all characters across all species by combining the two matrices R and C into a single large matrix using the Kroeneker product:\n\n$\\textbf{V} = \\textbf{R} ⊗ \\textbf{C} \\label{3.23}$\n\nThis matrix V is n ⋅ m × n ⋅ m, and describes the variances and covariances of all traits across all species.\n\nWe can return to our example of evolution along a single branch (Figure 3.4a). Imagine that we have two characters that are evolving under a multivariate Brownian motion model. We state the parameters of the model as:\n\n$\\begin{array}{lcr} \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{z}_1(0) \\ \\bar{z}_2(0) \\ \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\mathbf{R} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1^2 & \\sigma_{12} \\ \\sigma_{12} & \\sigma_2^2 \\ \\end{bmatrix} \\ \\end{array} \\label{3.24}$\n\nFor a single branch, C = [t1], so:\n\n$\\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{R} \\otimes \\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_1^2 & \\sigma_{12} \\ \\s",

Thinking they had come from the prostate gland, he named them prostaglandins. It has since been determined that they exist and are synthesized in virtually every cell of the body. Prostaglandins, are like hormones in that they act as chemical messengers, but do not move to other sites, but work right within the cells where they are synthesized.\n\nIntroduction\n\nProstaglandins are unsaturated carboxylic acids, consisting of of a 20 carbon skeleton that also contains a five member ring. They are biochemically synthesized from the fatty acid, arachidonic acid. See the graphic on the left. The unique shape of the arachidonic acid caused by a series of cis double bonds helps to put it into position to make the five member ring.\n\nStructure of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)\n\nProstaglandin Structure\n\nProstaglandins are unsaturated carboxylic acids, consisting of of a 20 carbon skeleton that also contains a five member ring and are based upon the fatty acid, arachidonic acid. There are a variety of structures one, two, or three double bonds. On the five member ring there may also be double bonds, a ketone, or alcohol groups. A typical structure is on the left graphic.\n\nFunctions of Prostaglandins\n\nThere are a variety of physiological effects including:\n\n1. Activation of the inflammatory response, production of pain, and fever. When tissues are damaged, white blood cells flood to the site to try to minimize tissue destruction. Prostaglandins are produced as a result.\n2. Blood clots form when a blood vessel is damaged. A type of prostaglandin called thromboxane stimulates constriction and clotting of platelets. Conversely, PGI2, is produced to have the opposite effect on the walls of blood vessels where clots should not be forming.\n3. Certain prostaglandins are involved with the induction of labor and other reproductive processes. PGE2 causes uterine contractions and has been used to induce labor.\n4. Prostaglandins are involved in several other organs such as the gastrointestinal tract (inhibit acid synthesis and increase secretion of protective mucus), increase blood flow in kidneys, and leukotriens promote constriction of bronchi associated with asthma.\n\nBall-and-stick model of the aspirin molecule, as found in the solid state.

Aspirin blocks an enzyme called cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which is involved with the ring closure and addition of oxygen to arachidonic acid converting to prostaglandins.

Learn how a change in the price level affects the equilibrium interest rate.\n\nNow let’s consider the effects of a price level increase in the money market. When the price level rises in an economy, the average price of all goods and services sold is increasing. Inflation is calculated as the percentage increase in a country’s price level over some period, usually a year. This means that in the period during which the price level increases, inflation is occurring. Thus studying the effects of a price level increase is the same as studying the effects of inflation.\n\nInflation can arise for several reasons that will be discussed later in this chapter. For now, we will imagine that the price level increases for some unspecified reason and consider the consequences.\n\nSuppose the money market is originally in equilibrium at point A in Figure 7.10.1 with real money supply \\(M^{S}/P_{\\$}’\\) and interest rate \\(i_{\\$}’\\). Suppose the price level increases, ceteris paribus. Again, the ceteris paribus assumption means that we assume all other exogenous variables in the model remain fixed at their original levels. In this exercise, it means that the money supply (\\(M^{S}\\)) and real GDP (\\(Y_{\\$}\\)) remain fixed. An increase in the price level (\\(P_{\\$}\\)) causes a decrease in the real money supply (\\(M^{S}/P_{\\$}\\)) since \\(M_{S}\\) remains constant. In the adjoining diagram, this is shown as a shift from \\(M^{S}/P_{\\$}’\\) to \\(M^{S}/P_{\\$}^″\\). At the original interest rate, \\(i_{\\$}’\\), the real money supply has fallen to level 2 along the horizontal axis, while real money demand remains at level 1. This means that money demand exceeds money supply and the actual interest rate is lower than the new equilibrium rate. Adjustment to the higher interest rate will follow the “interest rate too low” equilibrium story.\n\nMore intuition concerning these effects arises if one recalls that price level increases will increase the transactions demand for money. In this version, nominal money demand will exceed nominal money supply and set off the same adjustment process described in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe final equilibrium will occur at point B on the diagram. The real money supply will have fallen from level 1 to level 2 while the equilibrium interest rate has risen from \\(i_{\\$}'\\) to \\(i_{\\$}^″\\). Thus an increase in the price level (i.e., inflation) will cause an increase in average interest rates in an economy. In contrast, a decrease in the price level (deflation) will cause a decrease in average interest rates in an economy.\n\nKey Takeaways\n• An increase in the price level (i.e., inflation), ceteris paribus, will cause an increase in average interest rates in an economy. In contrast, a decrease in the price level (deflation), ceteris paribus, will cause a decrease in average interest rates in an economy.\nexercise\n1. Jeopardy Questions.

Understand why a company may develop different value propositions for different target markets.\n\nWhat Is a Value Proposition?\n\nIndividual buyers and organizational buyers both evaluate products and services to see if they provide desired benefits. For example, when you’re exploring your vacation options, you want to know the benefits of each destination and the value you will get by going to each place. Before you (or a firm) can develop a strategy or create a strategic plan, you first have to develop a value proposition. A value proposition is a thirty-second “elevator speech” stating the specific benefits a product or service offering provides a buyer. It shows why the product or service is superior to competing offers. The value proposition answers the questions, “Why should I buy from you or why should I hire you?” As such, the value proposition becomes a critical component in shaping strategy.\n\nThe following is an example of a value proposition developed by a sales consulting firm: “Our clients grow their business, large or small, typically by a minimum of 30–50% over the previous year. They accomplish this without working 80 hour weeks and sacrificing their personal lives” (Lake, 2009).\n\nNote that although a value proposition will hopefully lead to profits for a firm, when the firm presents its value proposition to its customers, it doesn’t mention its own profits. That’s because the goal is to focus on the external market or what customers want.\n\nFirms typically segment markets and then identify different target markets, or groups of customers, they want to reach when they are developing their value propositions. Target markets will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5. For now, be aware that companies sometimes develop different value propositions for different target markets just as individuals may develop a different value proposition for different employers. The value proposition tells each group of customers (or potential employers) why they should buy a product or service, vacation to a particular destination, donate to an organization, hire you, and so forth.\n\nOnce the benefits of a product or service are clear, the firm must develop strategies that support the value proposition. The value proposition serves as a guide for this process. In the case of our sales consulting firm, the strategies it develops must help clients improve their sales by 30–50 percent. Likewise, if a company’s value proposition states that the firm is the largest retailer in the region with the most stores and best product selection, opening stores or increasing the firm’s inventory might be a key part of the company’s strategy. Looking at Amazon’s value proposition, “Low price, wide selection with added convenience anytime, anywhere,” one can easily see how Amazon has been so successful1.\n\nIndividuals and students should also develop their own personal value propositions.

You may need to rearchitect the system first to enable shorter build times.\n\n• It can be hard to break some kinds of large modifications into meaningful updates that can be individually integrated.\n\nRationale\n\nMany practitioners advocate a process of continuous integration as a way to avoid a risky and painful big-bang integration [Boo94].\n\nRelated Patterns\n\nRegression Test After Every Change minimizes the risk of defects creeping in during integration.\n\nContinuous Integration [Boo94] [Bec00] is a proven way to Always Have a Running Version.\n\n7.07: Regression Test After Every Change\n\nIntent Build confidence by making sure that whatever worked before still works.\n\nProblems\n\nHow can you be sure that the last change you made won’t break the system?\n\nThis problem is difficult because:\n\n• In a complex system, small changes can have unexpected side effects. A seemingly innocuous change may break something without this being immediately discovered.\n\nYet, solving this problem is feasible because:\n\n• You have written test suites that express how the system should behave.\n\nSolution\n\nRun your regression test suite every time you think you have reached a stable state.\n\nTradeoffs\n\nPros\n\n• It is easier to Always Have a Running Version.\n\n• It is easier to Build Confidence as you proceed.\n\nCons\n\n• You must relentlessly write the tests.\n\nDifficulties\n\n• The legacy system may not have adequate regression tests defined.

The most common root is the square root. Let’s take a look at what roots are, how they relate to exponents, and how you find the square root of a number.\n\nSquares and Roots\n\nTo help understand square roots, let’s review some facts about exponents. Look at the table below.\n\nExponent Name Expanded Form\n$\\ 3^{2}$\n\n“Three squared”\n\n“Three to the second power”\n\n$\\ 3 \\cdot 3$\n$\\ 4^{5}$\n\n“Four to the fifth power”\n\n“Four to the fifth”\n\n\"Four raised to the power of five\"\n\n$\\ 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4$\n$\\ x^{3}$\n\n“$\\ x$ cubed”\n\n“$\\ x$ to the third power”\n\n“$\\ x$to the third”\n\n$\\ x \\cdot x \\cdot x$\n$\\ x^{n}$\n\n“$\\ x$ to the $\\ n$ th power”\n\n“$\\ x$ to the $\\ n$ th”\n\n“$\\ x$ to the power of $\\ n$”\n\n$\\ x \\cdot x \\cdot x_{\\ldots} \\cdot x$ n times\n\nYou can think of exponential numbers as “repeated multiplication.”\n\nJust as dividing is the inverse of multiplying, the inverse of raising a number to a power is taking the root of a number. The most common root (and the one you will be studying here) is called the square root. When you are trying to find the square root of a number (say, 25), you are trying to find a number that can be multiplied by itself to create that original number. In the case of 25, you can find that $\\ 5 \\cdot 5=25$, so 5 must be the square root.\n\nThe symbol for the square root is called a radical symbol and looks like this: $\\ \\sqrt{ \\quad}$. The expression $\\ \\sqrt{25}$ is read “the square root of twenty-five” or “radical twenty-five.” The number that is written under the radical symbol is called the radicand. Take a look at the following table.\n\nRadical Name Simplified Form\n$\\ \\sqrt{36}$\n\n“Square root of thirty-six”\n\n“Radical thirty-six”\n\n$\\ \\sqrt{36}=\\sqrt{6 \\cdot 6}=6$\n$\\ \\sqrt{100}$\n\n“Square root of one hundred”\n\n“Radical one hundred”\n\n$\\ \\sqrt{100}=\\sqrt{10 \\cdot 10}=10$\n$\\ \\sqrt{225}$\n\n“Square root of two hundred twenty-five”\n\n“Radical two hundred twenty-five”\n\n$\\ \\sqrt{225}=\\sqrt{15 \\cdot 15}=15$\n\nLook at $\\ \\sqrt{25}$ again. You may realize that there is another value that, when multiplied by itself, also results in 25. That number is -5.\n\n$\\ \\begin{array}{c} 5 \\cdot 5=25 \\ -5 \\cdot-5=25 \\end{array}$\n\nBy definition, the square root symbol always means to find the positive root, called the principal root. So while $\\ 5 \\cdot 5$ and $\\ -5 \\cdot-5$ both equal 25, only 5 is the principal root. You should also know that zero is special because it has only one square root: itself (since $\\ 0 \\cdot 0=0$).\n\nIf you know the principal square root, you can also find its opposite. (Recall that any number plus its opposite will equal 0. So, for instance, $\\ a+(-a)=0$.) In the table below, notice that while $\\ \\sqrt{x}$ will give",

But do they actually exist? And how do we go about looking for something that is many light years away, only about a few dozen kilometers across (if a stellar black hole), and completely black? It turns out that the trick is not to look for the black hole itself but instead to look for what it does to a nearby companion star.\n\nAs we saw, when very massive stars collapse, they leave behind their gravitational influence. What if a member of a double-star system becomes a black hole, and its companion manages to survive the death of the massive star? While the black hole disappears from our view, we may be able to deduce its presence from the things it does to its companion.\n\nRequirements for a Black Hole\n\nSo, here is a prescription for finding a black hole: start by looking for a star whose motion (determined from the Doppler shift of its spectral lines) shows it to be a member of a binary star system. If both stars are visible, neither can be a black hole, so focus your attention on just those systems where only one star of the pair is visible, even with our most sensitive telescopes.\n\nBeing invisible is not enough, however, because a relatively faint star might be hard to see next to the glare of a brilliant companion or if it is shrouded by dust. And even if the star really is invisible, it could be a neutron star. Therefore, we must also have evidence that the unseen star has a mass too high to be a neutron star and that it is a collapsed object—an extremely small stellar remnant.\n\nWe can use Kepler’s law (see Orbits and Gravity) and our knowledge of the visible star to measure the mass of the invisible member of the pair. If the mass is greater than about 3 MSun, then we are likely seeing (or, more precisely, not seeing) a black hole—as long as we can make sure the object really is a collapsed star.\n\nIf matter falls toward a compact object of high gravity, the material is accelerated to high speed. Near the event horizon of a black hole, matter is moving at velocities that approach the speed of light. As the atoms whirl chaotically toward the event horizon, they rub against each other; internal friction can heat them to temperatures of 100 million K or more. Such hot matter emits radiation in the form of flickering X-rays. The last part of our prescription, then, is to look for a source of X-rays associated with the binary system. Since X-rays do not penetrate Earth’s atmosphere, such sources must be found using X-ray telescopes in space.\n\nIn our example, the infalling gas that produces the X-ray emission comes from the black hole’s companion star.

These equation however do not take into consideration that normal forces and thus stresses may become negative and may exceed the tensile strength of the clay. If the tensile stresses exceed the tensile strength, tensile failure will occur and the clay will not fail by plastic shear failure, but by tensile failure. The failure mechanism in this case is named the Tear Type mechanism. Based on the Mohr circle, tensile cracks will occur under and angle of 45 degrees downwards with respect of the shear angle as is shown in Figure 7-26. When the blade is progressing with the cutting velocity, after a short while a so called secondary crack will occur under 90 degrees with the first (primary) crack. The model as derived in this chapter, does not assume that the tensile strength is exceeded at the moment of tensile crack forming over the full length of the tensile crack. The model assumes that the tensile strength is exceeded at the start of the tensile crack only. In order to determine whether the tensile strength is exceeded, the average shear stress in the shear plane is used. Of course there may be a stress distribution in the shear plane, leading to locally higher and lower shear stresses and thus normal stresses, but these cannot be determined with the methodology used. Only average stresses can be determined. The methodology applied however gives reasonable and practical tools to determine whether the Tear Type cutting mechanism will occur or not.\n\n7.5.2.

This piece of equipment traces its origin back to the ancient Egyptians who hung wet blankets across the doors of their homes. As the warm air passed through the blankets, water would evaporate and cool the air. The royalty went one step further and had servants fan wet cloths over jugs of water to get more evaporation and cooling.\n\nThe origin of the term \"swamp cooler\" is not known - they certainly don't work in a swamp. Best conditions for cooling include a high temperature (over $80^\\text{o} \\text{F}$) and a low humidity (preferably less than $30\\%$). These coolers work well in desert areas, but don't provide any cooling in the humid areas of the country.\n\nEvaporation\n\nA puddle of water left undisturbed eventually disappears. The liquid molecules escape into the gas phase, becoming water vapor. Vaporization is the process in which a liquid is converted to a gas. Evaporation is the conversion of a liquid to its vapor below the boiling temperature of the liquid. If the water is instead kept in a closed container, the water vapor molecules do not have a chance to escape into the surroundings and so the water level does not change. As some water molecules become vapor, an equal number of water vapor molecules condense back into the liquid state. Condensation is the change of state from a gas to a liquid.\n\nIn order for a liquid molecule to escape into the gas state, the molecule must have enough kinetic energy to overcome the intermolecular attractive forces in the liquid. Recall that a given liquid sample will have molecules with a wide range of kinetic energies. Liquid molecules that have this certain threshold kinetic energy escape the surface and become vapor. As a result, the liquid molecules that remain now have lower kinetic energy. As evaporation occurs, the temperature of the remaining liquid decreases. You have observed the effects of evaporative cooling. On a hot day, the water molecules in your perspiration absorb body heat and evaporate from the surface of your skin. The evaporating process leaves the remaining perspiration cooler, which in turn absorbs more heat from your body.\n\nA given liquid will evaporate more quickly when it is heated. This is because the heating process results in a greater fraction of the liquid's molecules having the necessary kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid. The figure below shows the kinetic energy distribution of liquid molecules at two temperatures. The numbers of molecules that have the required kinetic energy to evaporate are shown in the shaded area under the curve at the right. The higher temperature liquid $\\left( T_2 \\right)$ has more molecules that are capable of escaping into the vapor phase than the lower temperature liquid $\\left( T_1 \\right)$.\n\nAt 29,029 feet $\\left( 8848 \\: \\te",

The main passion the Impressionistic artists all shared was light and color, how the light made colors intense or changed the hue. They also wanted to capture the moment, sitting outside en plein aire, working with quick, dynamic brushstrokes on brushes loaded with paint, a new concept of nature and people, and how everything was portrayed on the canvas the impression of a view instead of smoothly blended details. The artists discovered how dark shadows, gray cloudy skies, or deep water had a continually changing variety of colors. The colors brushed with freedom formed the lines and contours, short, quick brushstrokes formed into recognizable objects.\n\nArtists had long painted outdoors, usually sketching partial images and completing them on larger canvases or panels in the studio. The Impressionist artists want to work outside, capturing a moment in time and exploiting the natural light found plein aire. A few crucial inventions facilitated the movement. Easels had long been wooden frames an artist rested a painting on in a studio, not portable. In the 19th century, the French Box Easel was invented, portable easels set on telescopic legs, a paint box to carry supplies, and a palette built into the easel, perfect for the artist trekking through the fields and hillsides searching for the ideal light. In 1841, John Goffe Rand invented the paint tube, a revolution for artists and an essential commodity for the Impressionists. He was an artist who was aggravated by how quickly his paints dried out or spoiled. Paint, at the time, was stored in breakable glass jars or pig bladders which were not resealable and hard to use. He invented a squeezable tube made of metal, preserving the paint's fluidity and removable in small amounts. Now the artists could take tubes of different colored paint into the fields and easily squeeze out the amount they needed.\n\nThe history of the Paris salons and Impressionism were intertwined; the Salon's rejection of the set of artists forced the independent artists to circumvent the salons and create their exhibitions and destiny. The Salon held annual shows, and in 1863, 5000 works from 3000 artists were submitted for entry; only 1000 were accepted based on the traditional and expected styles of art. A few young painters had one or two paintings, still conservative paintings; however, they generally met rejection. During this time, the painters became friends, learning from each other and finding new inspiration, although they also found poverty except the few from wealthy families.\n\nFrom 1874 to 1886, the Impressionists held their shows, apart from the Salon and its standards. The critics panned the artwork declaring the colors unblended, with little detail and visible brushstrokes, not artists deserving any serious attention. Degas became the principal promoter for the group, getting the artists to join togeth",

Term symbols for diatomic molecules are based on irreducible representations in linear symmetry groups, derived from spectroscopic notations. They usually consist of four parts: spin multiplicity, azimuthal angular momentum, total angular momentum and symmetry. All molecular term symbols discussed here are based on Russel-Saunders coupling.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMolecular term symbols mark different electronic energy levels of a diatomic molecule. These symbols are similar to atomic term symbols, since both follow the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme. Molecular term symbols employ symmetry labels from group theory. The possibility of an electronic transition can be deducted from molecular term symbols following selection rules. For multi-atomic molecules, symmetry labels play most of term symbols' roles.\n\nFor homonuclear diatomics, the term symbol has the following form:\n\n$^{2S+1}\\Lambda_{\\Omega,(g/u)}^{(+/-)}$\n\nwhereas Λ is the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the internuclear axis: Ω is the projection of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis; g/u is the parity; and +/− is the reflection symmetry along an arbitrary plane containing the internuclear axis. Λ may be one of the greek letters in the sequence: Σ Π Δ Φ... when Λ = 0, 1, 2, 3..., respectively. For heteronuclear diatomics, the term symbol does not include the g/u part, for there is not inversion center in the molecule.\n\nDetermining term symbols of diatomics\n\nLet's start with CO again. As we have seen before, the molecule has a close-shell configuration. Its ground state is a totally symmetric singlet, 1Σ+, since the only possible values of (S, Λ) are (0, 0). If one of the HOMO electrons on the 5σ+ orbital has jumped to the LUMO, this molecule will be in an excited state as follows.\n\nSuppose a CO molecule is in the excited state shown above. In order to know the term symbol of this state, a direct product of the labels is required for the two MO's with unpaired electrons. The multiplication is such as $\\Pi \\times \\Sigma^+ = \\Pi$. According to Pauli's exclusion rule, these two unpaired electrons can never share the same set of quantum numbers, therefore the spin degeneracy S can reach its maximum 3. The resulting term symbols are 1Π and 3Π.\n\nNow if we look at O2, it does not have a close-shell configuration at its ground state. There are two unpaired electrons each occupying one of the two degenerate 2π orbitals, which can be seen in the diagram below.\n\nThe term symbol for oxygen molecule at its ground state is therefore derived such as Π x Π = Σ+ + Σ- + [Δ], as the symbol in brackets does not allow the oxygen atoms to commute.\n\nTransition between electronic states of diatomics\n\nWe'll focus on selection rules. Like atomic electronic states, different selection rules apply when differently incurred transitions occur. Usually for electric dipole field induced transitions, the selection rules are the ",

                "source_content": "Homology\n\nOne of the key goals of sequence alignment is to identify homologous sequences (e.g., genes) in a genome. Two sequences that are homologous are evolutionarily related, specifically by descent from a common ancestor. The two primary types of homologs are orthologous and paralogous (refer to Figure 2.1411). Other forms of homology exist (e.g., xenologs), but they are outside the scope of these notes.\n\nOrthologs arise from speciation events, leading to two organisms with a copy of the same gene. For example, when a single species A speciates into two species B and C, there are genes in species B and C that descend from a common gene in species A, and these genes in B and C are orthologous (the genes continue to evolve independent of each other, but still perform the same relative function).\n\nParalogs arise from duplication events within a species. For example, when a gene duplication occurs in some species A, the species has an original gene B and a gene copy B′, and the genes B and B′ are paralogus. Generally, orthologous sequences between two species will be more closely related to each other than paralogous sequences. This occurs because orthologous typically (although not always) preserve function over time, whereas paralogous often change over time, for example by specializing a gene’s (sub)function or by evolving a new function. As a result, determining orthologous sequences is generally more important than identifying paralogous sequences when gauging evolutionary relatedness.\n\nNatural Selection\n\nThe topic of natural selection is a too large topic to summarize effectively in just a few short paragraphs; instead, this appendix introduces three broad types of natural selection: positive selection, negative selection, and neutral selection.\n\n• Positive selection occurs when a trait is evolutionarily advantageous and increases an individual’s fitness, so that an individual with the trait is more likely to have (robust) offspring. It is often associated with the development of new traits.\n• Negative selection occurs when a trait is evolutionarily disadvantageous and decreases an individual’s fitness. Negative selection acts to reduce the prevalence of genetic alleles that reduce a species’ fitness. Negative selection is also known as purifying selection due to its tendency to ’purify’ genetic alleles until only the most successful alleles exist in the population.\n• Neutral selection describes evolution that occurs randomly, as a result of alleles not affecting an indi- vidual’s fitness. In the absence of selective pressures, no positive or negative selection occurs, and the result is neutral selection.\n\nDynamic Programming v. Greedy Algorithms\n\nDynamic programming and greedy algorithms are somewhat similar, and it behooves one to know the distinctions between the two. Problems that may be solved using dynamic programming are typically optimization problems that exhibit two traits: 1. optimal substructure and 2. overlapping subproblems.\n\n",

Colonial aristocrats, such as peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain) or criollos (Spaniards born in the viceroyalties), worked as viceregal officials, merchants, or plantation owners. The artworks decorating their homes showcased their wealth and status in viceregal society. While these were initially imported from abroad, local artists eventually created them at home—as in the case of the biombo, a folding screen traditionally used in Asia.\n\nBiombos\n\nThe biombo became a common feature of aristocratic households in colonial Mexico. An example of a seventeenth-century double-sided biombo by the renowned Afro-Mexican painter Juan Correa depicts a historical narrative on one side, and an allegorical one on the other. The Encounter of Cortés and Moctezuma II, painted across ten panels, depicts the fateful encounter between the Mexica (more commonly known as the Aztecs) and Spaniards. At right, Cortés enters on horseback, while Moctezuma sits under a canopy as his attendants carry him.\n\nThe rank of both men is communicated through their position in the composition, as well as through dress. Cortés wears rich fabrics and a feathered helmet, while Moctezuma II wears an elaborate crown and holds a scepter. Correa depicts both men as equals, despite the inherent inequality and brutality of the Spanish conquest. Different from scenes depicted in some sixteenth-century codices, like the Toxcatl Massacre from Diego Durán’s Historia de las Indias de Nueva España e islas de la tierra firme (1579), Correa depicts a somewhat positive view of this encounter.\n\nOn the other side of the biombo is a depiction of the allegorical representations of Africa, Asia, America, and Europe. Correa draws particular attention to the continents of Asia and Europe, placed prominently at center and flanked by Africa at right and America at left. In using the identifiable portraits of the Spanish King Charles II and his first wife, Marie Louise of Orleans, dressed with the French royal fleur-de-lis (to represent Europe), Correa singles out this continent from the other parts of the world.\n\nCharles II turns his back on America and points his toes towards the text at bottom, which reads “Europa.” This gesture alludes to how Charles II “has triumphed over America,” and as a result, he can now gaze confidently and “with desire toward Asia and Africa.” [1] If this is the case, then the biombo depicts somewhat contradictory stories. The Encounter of Cortés and Moctezuma II focuses on equality and autonomy, but The Four Parts of the World showcases Europe’s global aspirations, an image that is more in line with the imperialist behavior of the period",

In this section, we will look at the recent natural changes in Earth's climate, and we will use these drivers to understand why the climate has changed.\n\nThe most recent period of Earth's geologic history—spanning the last 2.6 million years—is known as the quaternary period. This is an important period for us because it encompasses the entire period over which humans have existed—our species evolved about 200,000 years ago. We will examine how the climate has changed over this period in detail. By understanding recent natural processes of climate change, we will be able to better understand why scientists attribute the currently observed changes in global climate as being the result of human activity.\n\nQuaternary Climate — Information From Ice Cores\n\nHow do we know about the Quaternary climate? After all, most of the period predates human existence, and we have only been recording the conditions of climate for a few centuries. Scientists are able to make informed judgments about the climates of the deep past by using proxy data. Proxy data is information about the climate that accumulates through natural phenomena. In the previous module, for example, we discussed how 60-million-year-old crocodile fossils have been found in North Dakota. This gives us indirect information about the climate of the period—that the climate of the region was warmer than it is today. Although not as precise as climate data recorded by instruments (such as thermometers), proxy data has been recovered from a diverse array of natural sources, and provides a surprisingly precise picture of climate change through deep time.\n\nOne highly detailed record of past climate conditions has been recovered from the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. These ice sheets are built by snow falling on the ice surface and being covered by subsequent snowfalls. The compressed snow is transformed into ice. It is so cold in these polar locations that the ice doesn't melt even in the summers, so the ice is able to build up over hundreds of thousands of years. Because the ice at lower depths was produced by progressively earlier snowfalls, the age of the ice increases with depth, and the young",

Dissolved in this water are inorganic ions like sodium, potassium and calcium. But the distinctiveness of biochemistry derives from the vast numbers of complex, large, carbon compounds, that are made by living cells. You have probably learned that the major classes of biological molecules are proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. The first three of these major groups are macromolecules that are built as long polymers made up of smaller subunits or monomers, like strings of beads. The lipids, while not chains of monomers, also have smaller subunits that are assembled in various ways to make the lipid components of cells, including membranes. The chemical properties and three dimensional conformations of these molecules determine all the molecular interactions upon which life depends. Whether building structures within cells, transferring information, or catalyzing reactions, the activities of biomolecules are governed by their structures. The properties and shapes of macromolecules, in turn, depend on the subunits of which they are built.\n\nInteractive 2.1: The enzyme Hexokinase: as for all enzymes, the activity of hexokinase depends on its structure. Protein Database (PDB)\n\nWe will next examine the major groups of biological macromolecules: proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and lipids. The building blocks of the first three, respectively, are amino acids, monosaccharides (sugars), and nucleotides.

In extreme cases, if the frequency spectrum is too narrow, the perturbation might not effectively drive transitions to any available final states, making the rule less applicable.

The purpose of contract remedies is to compensate the non-breaching party for the losses suffered. In other words, remedies must put the non-breaching party in the position it would have been if there had been no breach.\n\nDamages\n\nDamages are the money paid by one party to another to discharge a legal liability.\n\nTypes of Monetary Damages Purpose\nCompensatory To make the non-breaching party “whole” as if breach did not occur\nConsequential To cover indirect but foreseeable losses flowing from the breach\nIncidental To cover direct losses flowing from the breach & to avoid further loss\nNominal To recognize legal breach although no actual damages resulted\nPunitive To punish and deter future wrongful behavior; only available if breach itself is a tort\nLiquidated To allow parties to determine value of contract in case of breach\n\nCompensatory Damages\n\nCompensatory damages are paid to compensate the non-breaching party for the loss suffered as a result of the breach. It is the general category of damages awarded to make the party whole. Compensatory damages include out-of-pocket losses and costs associated with the loss of the bargain. They are the primary damages in contract breach cases and are a direct, foreseeable result of the breach of contract.\n\nConsequential Damages\n\nA basic principle of contract law is that a person injured by breach of contract is not entitled to compensation unless the breaching party, at the time the contract was made, had reason to foresee the loss as a probable result of the breach.\n\nConsequential damages are damages that flow as a foreseeable but indirect result of the breach of contract. For example, a roofer takes longer to fix a leaky roof than specified in a contract. The delay results in a retailer remaining closed for an additional week until the roof is repaired. The loss of sales from that week are consequential damages.\n\nConsequential damages often include:\n\n• Loss of profits due to the interruption of normal business practices;\n• Loss of customers due to delays or cancellations; and\n• Cost of replacement goods or services.\n\nIncidental Damages\n\nIncidental damages are damages that are paid to the non-breaching party in an attempt to avoid further loss on account of the breach. These damages include additional costs incurred by the non-breaching party after the breach in a reasonable attempt to avoid further loss, even if that attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nFor example, an electrician contracts to install light fixtures in a warehouse within seven days. The electrician enters into a purchase agreement with a supplier to buy the fixtures which are to be delivered within three days. On the fifth day, the supplier notifies the electrician that it cannot fill the order, breaching the contract. Because he cannot fulfill his contract with another supplier in time, the electrician breaches his contract with the warehou",

Salting out is typically, but not limited to, the precipitation of large biomolecules such as proteins. In contrast to salting in, salting out occurs in aqueous solutions of high ionic strength that reduce the molecule's solubility causing certain proteins to precipitate. Ideally, the type of salt being used and the concentration of the salt can be varied to selectively precipitate a the molecule. In reality, salting out is an effective means for initial molecule purification, but lacks the ability for precise isolation of a specific protein.\n\nThe Mechanism Behind Salting Out\n\nThe conformation of large biomolecules in vivo is typically controlled by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the cellular environment. These interactions largely govern the molecule's final conformation by folding in such a way that most hydrophobic functional groups are shielded from the polar cellular environment. To achieve this conformation the molecule folds in such a way that all of the hydrophobic parts of a molecule are aggregated together and the hydrophilic groups are left to interact with the water. In the case of proteins it is the charged amino acids that allow selective salting out to occur. Charged and polar amino acids such as glutamate, lysine, and tyrosine require water molecules to surround them to remain dissolved. In an aqueous environment with a high ionic strength, the water molecules surround the charges of the ions and proteins. At a certain ionic strength, the water molecules are no longer able to support the charges of both the ions and the proteins. The result is the precipitation of the least soluble so",

A ligand is a molecule that binds another specific molecule, in some cases, delivering a signal in the process. Ligands can thus be thought of as signaling molecules. Ligands interact with proteins in target cells, which are cells that are affected by chemical signals; these proteins are also called receptors.\n• 44.2: Overview of Hormone Action\nHormones cause cellular changes by binding to receptors on target cells. The number of receptors on a target cell can increase or decrease in response to hormone activity. Hormones can affect cells directly through intracellular hormone receptors or indirectly through plasma membrane hormone receptors. Lipid-derived (soluble) hormones can enter the cell by diffusing across the plasma membrane and binding to DNA to regulate gene transcription.\n• 44.3: The Pituitary and Hypothalamus- The Body's Control Centers\nThere are three basic types of hormones: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide. Lipid-derived hormones are structurally similar to cholesterol and include steroid hormones such as estradiol and testosterone. Amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules and include the adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Peptide hormones are polypeptide chains or proteins and include the pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), and oxytocin.\n• 44.4: The Major Peripheral Endocrine Glands\nHormones have a wide range of effects and modulate many different body processes. The key regulatory processes that will be examined here are those affecting the excretory system, the reproductive system, metabolism, blood calcium concentrations, growth, and the stress response.\n• 44.5: Other Hormones and Their Effects\nBoth the endocrine and nervous systems use chemical signals to communicate and regulate the body's physiology. The endocrine system releases hormones that act on target cells to regulate development, growth, energy metabolism, reproduction, and many behaviors. The nervous system releases neurotransmitters or neurohormones that regulate neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells. \n\n44: The Endocrine System \n\nSkills to Develop\n\n• Describe four types of signaling found in multicellular organisms\n• Compare internal receptors with cell-surface receptors\n• Recognize the relationship between a ligand’s structure and its mechanism of action\n\nThere are two kinds of communication in the world of living cells. Communication between cells is called intercellular signaling, and communication within a cell is called intracellular signaling. An easy way to remember the distinction is by understanding the Latin origin of the prefixes: inter- means \"between\" (for example, intersecting lines are those that cross each other) and intra- means \"inside\" (like intravenous).\n\nChemical signals are released by signal",

                "source_content": "Imprinted genes are genes whose expression is determined by the parent that contributed them. Imprinted genes violate the usual rule of inheritance that both alleles in a heterozygote are equally expressed.\n\nExamples of the usual rule:\n\n• If a child inherits the gene for blood group A from either parent and the gene for group B from the other parent, the child's blood group will be AB.\n• If a child inherits the gene encoding hemoglobin A from either parent and the gene encoding hemoglobin S from the other parent, the child's red blood cells will contain roughly equal amounts of the two types of hemoglobin.\n\nBut there are a few exceptions to this rule. A small number of genes in mammals (~80 of them at a recent count) and in angiosperms have been found to be imprinted. Because most imprinted genes are repressed, either\n\n• the maternal (inherited from the mother) allele is expressed exclusively because the paternal (inherited from the father) allele is imprinted or\n• vice versa.\n\nThe process begins during gamete formation when\n\n• in males certain genes are imprinted in developing sperm and\n• in females, others are imprinted in the developing egg.\n\nAll the cells in a resulting child will have the same set of imprinted genes from both its father and its mother EXCEPT for those cells (\"germplasm\") that are destined to go on to make gametes. All imprints — both maternal and paternal — are erased in them.\n\nExamples\n\nIGF2\n\n— the gene encoding the insulin-like growth factor-2\n\nIn humans (and other mammals like mice and pigs) the IGF2 allele inherited from the father (paternal) is expressed; the allele inherited from the mother is not.\n\nIf both alleles should begin to be expressed in a cell, that cell may develop into a cancer.\n\nIGF2r\n\n— the gene encoding the cell receptor for Igf-2\n\nIn mice the IGF2r allele inherited from the mother is expressed; that from the father is not. Differential imprinting accounts for this, and the mechanism is described below.\n\nXIST\n\n— the gene encoding the RNA that converts one of the X chromosomes in a female cell into an inactive Barr body. This process is random in the cells of the female fetus and thus is NOT an example of imprinting. However, all the cells of her extraembryonic membranes (which form the amnion, placenta, and umbilical cord) have the father's X chromosome inactivated. Imprinting of the XIST locus accounts for this.\n\nMechanism of parental imprinting\n\nThe process of imprinting starts in the gametes where the allele destined to be inactive in the new embryo (either the father's or the mother's as the case may be) is \"marked\". The mark appears to be methylation of the DNA in the promoter(s) of the gene.\n\nMethyl groups are added to cytosines (Cs) in the DNA. When this occurs at stretches of alternating Cs and Gs called CpG sites in a promoter, it prevents binding of transcription factors to the promoter thus shutting down expression of the gene.\n\nAlthough methylation seems to be the imprinting signal, keeping t",

A streamline is a line that represent the collection of all the point where the velocity is tangent to the velocity vector. Equation (25) represents the unit vector. The total differential is made of three components as\n\n$\\widehat{\\ell} = \\widehat{\\mathbf{i}} \\,\\dfrac{U_x}{U} + \\widehat{\\mathbf{j}} \\,\\dfrac{U_y}{U} + \\widehat{\\mathbf{k}} \\,\\dfrac{U_z}{U} = \\widehat{\\mathbf{i}} \\,\\dfrac{dx}{d\\ell} + \\widehat{\\mathbf{j}} \\,\\dfrac{dy}{d\\ell} + \\widehat{\\mathbf{k}} \\,\\dfrac{dz}{d\\ell}$\n\nIt can be noticed that $dx\\left/d\\ell\\right.$ is $x$ component of the unit vector in the direction of $x$. The discussion proceed from equation (41) that\n\n$\\dfrac{U_x}{dx} = \\dfrac{U_y}{dy} = \\dfrac{U_z}{dz}$\nEquation (42) suggests a system of three ordinary differential equations as a way to find the stream function. For example, in the $x$-$y$y plane the ordinary differential equation is\n\n$\\label{if:eq:xyODE} \\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \\dfrac{U_y}{U_x}$\n\nExample 10.2\n\nWhat are stream lines that should be obtained in Example 10.1.\n\nSolution 10.2\n\nUtilizing equation (43) results in\n\n$\\label{streamLineSimple:gov} \\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \\dfrac{U_y}{U_x} = \\dfrac{-4\\,y^3 }{2\\,x}$\n\nThe solution of the non-linear ordinary differential obtained by separation of variables as\n\n$\\label{streamLineSimple:seperation} -\\dfrac{dy}{2\\,y^3} = \\dfrac{dx}{2\\,x}$ The solution of equation (??) is obtained by integration as\n\n$\\label{streamLineSimple:sol} \\dfrac{1}{4\\,{y}^{2}} = {\\ln\\, x } + C$\n\nFig. 10.1 Streamlines to explain stream function.\n\nFrom the discussion above it follows that streamlines are continuous if the velocity field is continuous. Hence, several streamlines can be drawn in the field as shown in Figure 10.1. If two streamline (blue) are close an arbitrary line (brown line) can be drawn to connect these lines. A unit vector (cyan) can be drawn perpendicularly to the brown line. The velocity vector is almost parallel (tangent) to the streamline (since the streamlines are very close) to both streamlines. Depending on the orientation of the connecting line (brown line) the direction of the unit vector is determined. Denoting a stream function as $\\psi$ which in the two dimensional case is only function of $x,y$, that is\n\n$\\label{if:eq:streamFun2D} \\psi = f\\left( x, y\\right) \\Longrightarrow {d\\psi} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} \\,dx + \\dfrac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y} \\,dy$\n\nIn this stage, no meaning is assigned to the stream function.

For decades, this was the primary source of information about Weber’s life. Recently, however, our knowledge in this area has been greatly supplemented by Joachim Radkau’s Max Weber: A Biography, published in English in 2009. Radkau’s sympathetic portrait nevertheless includes several less flattering details of Weber’s personality and character, not included in his wife’s biography. For more on Weber’s intellectual development, and less about his personal life, read Fritz Ringer’s Max Weber: An Intellectual Biography, published in 2004.\n\nOverview\n\nMax, full name Maximilian Karl Emil, Weber was born in Erfurt, a bustling commercial city in what is now central Germany, on April 21, 1864. Weber spent his life in a rapidly industrializing and increasing militaristic Germany, living through the devastations of the first World War, and witnessing the rise of fascism during the early years of the Weimar Republic. Like many writers and thinkers of his day, he was interested in how this new industrial society came to be. His most famous work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, was a partial answer to that question. Weber would also come to create a particular approach to sociological inquiry, more focused on interpretation and less focused on policy proposals than Durkheim’s.\n\nSocial Background/Family\n\nWeber was the first of eight children, born to a wealthy statesman (Max Weber, Sr.) and his somewhat devout wife Helene (Fallenstein). The Webers had been a prosperous family for many generations, making their money in the linen trade. Max grew up in bourgeois comfort, in a home devoted to politics and intellectual pursuits. In fact, Weber’s younger brother, Alfred, would also become a sociologist.\n\nEducation and Training\n\nIn 1882, Max earned his high school diploma and, according to his wife’s biography, “also helped his friends to cheat their way through.” His teachers, she claimed expressed some doubts about his moral maturity, finding him a troublesome if intelligent student. At age 18, he enrolled at the University of Heidelberg, where he followed in his father’s footsteps by studying law. He also took up fencing at his father’s fraternity house. By all accounts he led an active social life in college, visiting other bourgeois families, drinking, fencing, and even dueling (from which he suffered a distinctive scar on his face for the rest of his life). Marianne tells us he had no talent for saving money and would often ask for increases to his allowance.\n\nIn his second year, he took time off to serve in the military, but found military life difficult. Despite becoming a squad leader, he complained in a letter home that “the military exist",

When Hewlett-Packard produces printers, the company has three possible methods that can be used to allocate overhead costs to products—plantwide allocation, department allocation, and activity-based allocation (called activity-based costing). How do managers decide which allocation method to use?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe choice of an allocation method depends on how managers decide to group overhead costs and the desired accuracy of product cost information. Groups of overhead costs are called cost pools1. For example, Hewlett Packard’s printer production division may choose to collect all factory overhead costs in one cost pool and allocate those costs from the cost pool to each product using one predetermined overhead rate. Or Hewlett Packard may choose to have several cost pools (perhaps for each department, such as assembly, packaging, and quality control) and allocate overhead costs from each department cost pool to products using a separate predetermined overhead rate for each department. In general, the more cost pools used, the more accurate the allocation process.\n\nPlantwide Allocation\n\nQuestion: Let’s look at SailRite Company, which was presented at the beginning of the chapter. The managers at SailRite like the idea of using the plantwide allocation method to allocate overhead to the two sailboat models produced by the company. How would SailRite implement the plantwide allocation method?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe plantwide allocation2 method uses one predetermined overhead rate to allocate overhead costs.Regardless of the approach used to allocate overhead, a predetermined overhead rate is established for each cost pool. The predetermined overhead rate is calculated as follows (from Chapter 2): $\\text{Predetermined overhead rate} = \\frac{\\text{Estimated overhead costs}}{\\text{Estimated activity in allocation base}}$When activity-based costing is used, the denominator can also be called estimated cost driver activity. One cost pool accounts for all overhead costs, and therefore one predetermined overhead rate is used to apply overhead costs to products. You learned about this approach in Chapter 2 where one predetermined rate—typically based on direct labor hours, direct labor costs, or machine hours—was used to allocate overhead costs. (Remember, the focus here is on the allocation of overhead costs. Direct materials and direct labor are easily traced to the product and therefore are not a part of the overhead allocation process.)\n\nUsing SailRite Company as an example, assume annual overhead costs are estimated to be $8,000,000 and direct labor hours are used for the plantwide allocation base. Management estimates that a total of 250,000 direct labor hours are worked annually. These estimates are b",

Compare and contrast fairness of voting using majority criterion.\n2. Compare and contrast fairness of voting using head-to-head criterion.\n3. Compare and contrast fairness of voting using monotonicity criterion.\n4. Compare and contrast fairness of voting using irrelevant alternatives criterion.\n5. Apply Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem when evaluating voting fairness.\n\nNow that we’ve covered a variety of voting methods and discussed their differences and similarities, you might be leaning toward one method over another. You will need to convince the other founders of Imaginaria that your preference will be the best for the country. Before your collaborators approve the inclusion of a voting method in the constitution, they will want to know that the voting method is a fair method. In this section, we will formally define the characteristics of a fair system. We will analyze each voting previously discussed to determine which characteristics of fairness they have, and which they do not. In order to guarantee one ideal, we must often sacrifice others.\n\nThe Majority Criterion\n\nOne of the most fundamental concepts in voting is the idea that most voters should be in favor of a candidate for a candidate to win, and that a candidate should not win without majority support. This concept is known as the majority criterion.\n\nWith respect to the four main ranked voting methods we have discussed—plurality, ranked-choice, pairwise comparison, and the Borda count method—we will explore two important questions:\n\n1. Which of these voting systems satisfy the majority criterion and which do not?\n2. Is it always “fair” for a voting system to satisfy the majority criterion?\n\nKeep in mind that this criterion only applies when one of the candidates has a majority. So, the examples we will analyze will be based on scenarios in which a single candidate has more than 50 percent of the vote.\n\nExample 11.16\n\nRoommates Choose Fast Food\n\nIt’s final exams week and seven college students are hungry.

However, there is no magic word one can use to reduce uncertainty and create a similar meaning. This chapter clarifies how language can help create a sense of connection as well as provide a barrier.\n\nVerbal Communication Defined:\n\nVerbal communication refers to words. Words are a type of symbol. The free, Open Education Resource, Communication in the Real World: An Introduction to Communication Studies (2016) explains:\n\nHalverson-Wente photo, used with permission\n\nOur language system is primarily made up of symbols. A symbol is something that stands in for or represents something else. Symbols can be communicated verbally (speaking the word hello), in writing (putting the letters H-E-L-L-O together), or nonverbally (waving your hand back and forth). In any case, the symbols we use stand in for something else, like a physical object or an idea; they do not actually correspond to the thing being referenced in any direct way (pp.113-114).\n\nAs noted above, “verbal communication” is our language use. In intercultural communication, there may exist either entirely different language use, a person using a second language, or even, both individuals communicating in a common second language.\n\nPhoto Submitted by Jordan Wente, used with permission\n\nSpeaking in a different language gives one a new outlook. Jordan, a Rochester Community and Technical College Alum, pursued his master’s degree in Denmark. Generally, the international university he attended used English as the common currency of language. However, as one of his college majors was Spanish, he soon found himself drawn to speaking Spanish with his classmates from Spanish-speaking countries and a special bond was made.\n\nLanguage defines. The defining ability of language relates to intercultural communication and barriers, such as stigma, that language can impose. Galinsky, A. D., Hugenberg, K., Groom, C., & Bodenhausen, G. (2003) explain the power of stigma:\n\ncreative commons photo from burst.shopify.com\n\nStigma, according to Goffman, is an attribute that discredits and reduces the person ‘from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one’ (Goffman, 1963, p.3). Social stigma links a negatively valued attribute to a social identity or group membership. Stigma is said to exist when individuals ‘possess (or are believed to possess) some attribute, or characteristic, that conveys a social identity that is devalued in a particular social context’ (Crocker, Major & Steele, 1998, p.505). Given these criteria, there are myriad groups in our own culture that tend to be The Reappropriation of Stigmatizing Labels considered stigmatized. Ethnic minorities, such as African Americans or Native Americans, persons with physical or mental disabilities, gay men and lesbians, and the obese can all be considered stigmatized groups.",

Some projects like biographies or historical dramas require vast amounts of research, while others require very little because you are creating an original world. You also can choose where to add research into your process, for some projects it may be in the beginning as you are gathering ideas and other times it may be once you have developed characters and have identified a setting and conflict. You want to research as much as you can about the world and characters of your play, however do not get lost in research and forget that research is meaningless if it never results in a play.\n\nWhen looking for Ideas\n\nWhen you first begin the process of writing you will go through one of two stages. Stage one is I have too many ideas. Stage two is I have no ideas at all. Regardless of which stage you begin your journey in, rest assured that you will find something that inspires you. It may be a headline, a product, a phrase, a song...anything and from that inspiration you will begin developing your world. Once you have a location, profession, event, or general idea of the subject matter of your play you can begin your research. Start by looking at the world you wish to inhabit for your play. Then ask yourself where you can find materials to learn about this world. The world should be interesting to you so that you can attack your research and have fun while you are exploring. Learn everything you can and as you learn you will find that you begin discovering additional questions. Follow the trail of questions and see where it leads you. Once you feel that you have become familiar with the world, use your research to inform your characters and plot. Only use research that helps the plot and tells the story. Be willing to let fun facts go, because your audience only cares about the story and your research was there to reinforce the story’s authenticity.\n\nInterviews\n\nOne incredibly helpful research tool is to interview people with experience in the subject matter or world of your play. If you simply tell people that you are researching information for a play or story you will be amazed at how much people are willing to help. Interview as many people as you can. When you interview, LISTEN. Remember you are there to gain knowledge from their experience. You can take notes or record the interview. Your rule should be to Listen, Listen, Listen, then Ask strategic questions.\n\nPlaywriting Activity 1\n• Make a list of ideas that you are interested in writing a play about.\n• Choose one idea and find 5 sources to learn about for your story.\n• Find a friend or partner and see if they can help you come up with any additional sources.\n• Go research and take notes.\nPlaywriting Activity 2\n• Choose an environment. Research that environment and its inhabitants.\n• Find someone from that location and interview them. Listen, listen, listen, and then ask strategic questions.

Why is variability necessary and where does it come from?\n\nPersonal Application Questions\n\nQ6\n\nYou share half of your genetic makeup with each of your parents, but you are no doubt very different from both of them.

How do you think your unique environment and experiences have contributed to some of the differences you see?\n\nSolution\n\nD\n\nB\n\nC\n\nB\n\nS5\n\nVariability is essential for natural selection to work. If all individuals are the same on a given trait, there will be no relative difference in their reproductive success because everyone will be equally adapted to their environments on that trait. Mutations are one source of variability, but sexual reproduction is another important source of variation given that individuals inherit half of their genetic makeup from each of their parents.\n\n3.2: Cells of the Nervous System\n\nLearning how the cells and organs (like the brain) function, help us understand the biological basis behind human psychology.

                "source_content": "Remember way back in Chapter One we introduced a distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning? Well, we’ve spent a lot of time on deductive reasoning, so we should spend at least a bit talking about inductive reasoning. Now, informal fallacies often have to do with inductive reasoning, and argument maps are a way of diagramming both inductive and deductive arguments, so we haven’t exactly skipped over inductive reasoning, but there are a few things to discuss that deal most specifically with a few different sorts of inductive arguments.\n\nScientists engage in a particular kind of reasoning to get from the evidence they collect to a theory about how the world works. This type of reasoning is “ampliative,” meaning the theory that the sun always rises in the morning in the East and sets in the evening in the West is based on seeing a relatively small number of sunrises and sunsets. Obviously, no one has seen all of the sunrises that ever happened. So how do we know? We add to the evidence by inferring conclusions that go beyond the evidence they have.\n\nWe everyday folks also engage in this kind of reasoning all the time. I get in my car, turn my car, it doesn’t start, and I begin to hypothesize what might be the cause. I notice that most of the men I talk to have deeper voices than most of the women I talk to and I (perhaps incorrectly?) infer that men tend to have deeper voices than women. I get cold, put my jacket on, and feel warmer. What do I infer? That the jacket keeps me warm.\n\nWhat these everyday examples have in common with scientific reasoning is that they, too, are ampliative—the conclusions are stronger claims than the premises or evidence. If we couldn’t make inductive inferences, we’d be stuck in a strange situation. I’d see the sun rise and then learn…that the sun just rose. I wouldn’t learn anything over and above that particular fact. I might put my jacket on when I’m cold, get warmer, and learn…that I put my jacket on this one time and got warmer this one time. Not very exciting conclusions. We need induction to get conclusions that go beyond our evidence.\n\nThis chapter will cover a series of types of induction. First, we’ll cover Hypothetical Reasoning, which is the kind of reasoning that people call the “scientific method.” After that, we’ll cover the basics of Causal Reasoning, Statistical Generalization, and Arguing from Analogy. We’ll also explore the logic of each a bit and look at some pitfalls of each kind of reasoning. \n\n08: Inductive Reasoning - hypothetical causal statistical and others \n\nSuppose I’m going on a picnic and I’m only selecting items that fit a certain rule. You want to find out what rule I’m using, so you offer up some guesses at items I might want to bring:\n\nA Banana\n\nAn Egg Salad Sandwich\n\nA grape soda\n\nSuppose now that I tell you that I’m okay with the first two, but I won’t bring the third.

Assess the effectiveness of leadership behavior exhibited in an illustrative academic situation\n\n“The hope of the world is that wisdom can arrest conflict between brothers. I believe that war is the deadly harvest of arrogant and unreasoning minds.”\n\nDwight Eisenhower\n\nTo lead a group successfully through conflict requires patience, goodwill, and determination. Robert Bolton, Bolton, R. (1979). People skills: How to assert yourself, listen to others, and resolve conflicts. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall noted that leaders with low levels of defensiveness tend to help people in their organizations avert unnecessary strife because they are able to focus on understanding and dealing with challenges rather than on saving face or overcoming resistance from others in their groups. Bolton also wrote that employing power judiciously, displaying charisma, and employing effective communication skills can positively affect the way conflict is handled. In this section, we will examine four general roles a leader may adopt with respect to preparing for inevitable instances of conflict. We will also provide an example of how one leader adopted the fourth role in a conflict situation.\n\nThe Leader as Motivator\n\nJust as it takes more than one person to create conflict, it generally requires more than a single individual to resolve it. A leader should, therefore, try somehow to cause other members of a group to identify benefits to themselves of engaging in productive rather than destructive conflict. Randy Komisar, a prominent Silicon Valley executive who has worked with companies such as WebTV and TiVo and co-founded Claris Corporation, had this to say about the importance of this kind motivational role as his companies grew:\n\n“I found that the art wasn’t in getting the numbers to foot, or figuring out a clever way to move something down the assembly line. It was in getting somebody else to do that and to do it better than I could ever do, in encouraging people to exceed their own expectations; in inspiring people to be great; and in getting them to do it all together, in harmony. That was the high art.”Komisar, R., & Lineback, K. (2000). The monk and the riddle: The education of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business Press. We’ll talk later about specific strategies that leaders and other group members can employ to manage conflict by means of motivation and other strategies.\n\nThe Leader as Delegator\n\nNo leader, even the leader of a handful of other people in a small team, can handle all the challenges or do all the work of a group. In fact, you’ve probably encountered leaders throughout your life who either exhausted themselves or alienated other group members—or both!—because they tried to do just that. Beyond accepting the sheer impossibility of shouldering all of a group’s work, a leader can attempt to prevent or manage conflict by j",

Here, we will look at two case studies of scientific language.\n\n10.2.1.1 Case study: Keywords in scientific writing\n\nThere are a number of keyword-based analyses of academic writing (cf., for example, Scott & Tribble 2006 on literary criticism, Römer & Wulff 2010 on academic student essays). Instead of replicating one of these studies in detail, let us look more generally at the Learned and Scientific Writing section of the LOB (Section J), using the rest of the corpus (all sections except Section J) as a reference corpus. $Table \\text { } 10.5$ shows the keywords for this section.\n\nIt is immediately obvious from the preponderance of scientific terminology that we are dealing with Scientific English – there are general scientific terms like fig(ure), data experiment or model, mathematical terms and symbols (equation, values, the equals and percent signs), and a few words from chemistry (oxygen, sodium) (the reason the @ sign appears on this list is because it is used to mark places in the corpus where material such as mathematical formulae and operators have been deleted).\n\nIt may not be surprising that scientific terminology dominates in a corpus of Scientific English, but it demonstrates that keyword analysis works. Given this, we can make some more profound observations on the basis of the list in $Table \\text { }10.5$. For example, we observe that certain kinds of punctuation are typical of academic writing in general (such as the parentheses, which we already suspected based on the analysis of the fish population report in Section 10.1 above).\n\n$Table \\text { } 10.5$: Key words in the Learned and Scientific Writing section of LOB\n\nEven more interestingly, keyword analysis can reveal function words that are characteristic for a particular language variety and thus give us potential insights into grammatical structures that may be typical for it; for example, is, the and of are among the most significant keywords of Scientific English. The last two are presumably related to the nominal style that is known to characterize academic texts, while the higher-than-normal frequency of is may be due to the prevalence of definitions, statements of equivalence, etc. This (and other observations made on the basis of keyword analysis) would of course have to be followed up by more detailed analyses of the function these words serve – but keyword analysis tells us what words are likely to be interesting to investigate.\n\n10.2.1.2 Case study: [a + __ + of] in Scientific English\n\nOf course, keyword analysis is not the only way to study lexical characteristics of language varieties.

                "source_content": "Democratic politicians were astonished in 2010 when their early polls of sample voters showed Republican Scott Brown was favored by a majority of voters and so would win the special election to fill the Senate seat that the late Democrat Teddy Kennedy had occupied for over 40 years. Based on their poll results, they mounted an intense, but ultimately unsuccessful, effort to save the seat for their party.\n\nVoter Poll\n\nSuppose at some time before the election that $p$ was the fraction of voters favoring Scott Brown. We want to estimate this unknown fraction $p$. Suppose we have some random process for selecting voters from registration lists that selects each voter with equal probability. We can define an indicator variable, $K$, by the rule that $K = 1$ if the random voter most prefers Brown, and $K = 0$ otherwise.\n\nNow to estimate $p$, we take a large number, $n$, of random choices of voters3 and count the fraction who favor Brown. That is, we define variables $K_1, K_2, \\ldots$, where $K_i$ is interpreted to be the indicator variable for the event that the $i$th chosen voter prefers Brown. Since our choices are made independently, the $K_i$’s are independent. So formally, we model our estimation process by assuming we have mutually independent indicator variables $K_1, K_2, \\ldots$, each with the same probability, $p$, of being equal to 1. Now let $S_n$ be their sum, that is,\n\n$\\label{19.4.1} S_n ::= \\sum_{i=1}^{n} K_i.$\n\nThe variable $S_n/n$ describes the fraction of sampled voters who favor Scott Brown. Most people intuitively, and correctly, expect this sample fraction to give a useful approximation to the unknown fraction, $p$.\n\nSo we will use the sample value, $S_n/n$, as our statistical estimate of $p$. We know that $S_n$ has a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$; we can choose $n$, but $p$ is unknown.\n\nHow Large a Sample?\n\nSuppose we want our estimate to be within 0.04 of the fraction, $p$, at least 95% of the time. This means we want\n\n$\\label{19.4.2} \\text{Pr}\\left[\\left| \\frac{S_n}{n} - p \\right| \\leq 0.04 \\right] \\geq 0.95.$\n\nSo we’d better determine the number, $n$ of times we must poll voters so that inequality (\\ref{19.4.2}) will hold. Chebyshev's Theorem offers a simple way to determine such a $n$.\n\nSn is binomially distributed. Equation (19.3.10), combined with the fact that $p(1 - p)$ is maximized when $p = 1 - p$, that is, when $p = 1/2$ (check for yourself!), gives\n\n$\\label{19.4.3} \\text{Var}[S_n] = n(p(1-p)) \\leq n \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{n}{4}.$\n\nNext, we bound the variance of $S_n/n$:\n\n\\begin{align} \\nonumber \\text{Var}\\left[ \\frac{S_n}{n}\\right] &= \\left( \\frac{1}{n} ^2 \\right) \\text{Var}[S_n] & (\\text{(Square Multiple Rule for Variance (19.3.4)}) \\ \\nonumber &\\leq \\frac{1}{n} ^2 \\frac{n}{4} & (\\text{by (19.4.3)}) \\ &= \\label{19.4.4} \\frac{1}{4n} \\end{align}\n\nUsing Chebyshev’s bound and (\\ref{19.4.4}) we have:\n\n$\\label{19.4.5} \\text{Pr}\\left[\\left| \\frac{S_n}{n} - p \\right| \\geq 0.04 \\right] \\leq \\frac{\\text",

You will also learn about methods of acquisition and transfer of real property. At the conclusion of this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n\n• What is the difference between real property and personal property?\n• How is ownership interest in personal property transferred?\n• What interests in real property exist?\n• How is real property acquired and transferred?\n• What legal relationships exist between landlord and tenants?\n\nThe concepts of property and ownership are fundamental to any society. Property refers to tangible and intangible items that can be owned. Ownership is a concept that means the right to exclude others. Disputes over both have been at the root of conflicts and wars since time immemorial. Without laws to protect property ownership, the stability of our society would be seriously undermined. For example, if law did not protect ownership interests in property, then people would have to protect their property themselves. This means that people would have to hire their own security forces to protect their property, or they would have to stand guard over their property personally. It would be difficult to get anything else done. Such a system would likely result in the development of powerful factions. Those with the greatest power would dominate property ownership, and weaker members of society would be at their mercy. For example, one of the opening scenes of the movie Black Hawk Down illustrates a U.N. food distribution point in Mogadishu, Somalia. As depicted in that scene, people were waiting to receive the distribution of food, but a powerful, armed faction seized the cargo and opened fire on them. Obviously, such a system of property ownership would prove to be very unsettling, and it would lead to great instability in our economic system.\n\nOur legal system creates a peaceful means to acquire, retain, and divest of property, and to settle property disputes. It punishes those who operate outside of those rules. Indeed, those who do not acquire property lawfully or who do not settle property disputes within the confines of our legal system are subjected to criminal and civil penalties.\n\nIn the United States, our legal system ensures the ability to own property to everyone that the system recognizes can own property. Of course, not everyone has always been able to own property. The history of the United States is replete with examples of exclusion from the property ownership system. For example, at various times and in different ways, married women, African Americans, and people of Chinese and Japanese descent have been subject to restrictions regarding the ownership of real property. Because property law is a state law issue, those restrictions and exclusions varied from state to state. Tod",

Mills\n\n96 Ariz. 377, 396 P.2d 5 (Ariz. 1964)\n\nLOCKWOOD, VICE CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nDefendants appeal from a conviction on two counts of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of AR.S. §§ 13-661.A3. and 13-663.A1. The material facts, viewed “…in the light most favorable to sustaining the conviction,” are as follows: Defendant William Mills was a builder and owned approximately 150 homes in Tucson in December, 1960. Mills conducted his business in his home. In 1960 defendant Winifred Mills, his wife, participated in the business generally by answering the telephone, typing, and receiving clients who came to the office.\n\nIn December 1960, Mills showed the complainant, Nathan Pivowar, a house at 1155 Knox Drive and another at 1210 Easy Street, and asked Pivowar if he would loan money on the Knox Drive house. Pivowar did not indicate at that time whether he would agree to such a transaction. Later in the same month Nathan Pivowar told the defendants that he and his brother, Joe Pivowar, would loan \\$5,000 and \\$4,000 on the two houses. Three or four days later Mrs. Mills, at Pivowar’s request, showed him these homes again.\n\nMills had prepared two typed mortgages for Pivowar. Pivowar objected to the wording, so in Mills’ office Mrs. Mills retyped the mortgages under Pivowar’s dictation. After the mortgages had been recorded on December 31, 1960, Pivowar gave Mills a bank check for \\$5,791.87, some cash, and a second mortgage formerly obtained from Mills in the approximate sum of \\$3,000. In exchange Mills gave Pivowar two personal notes in the sums of \\$5,250.00 and \\$4,200.00 and the two mortgages as security for the loan.\n\nAlthough the due date for Mills’ personal notes passed without payment being made, the complainant did not present the notes for payment, did not demand that they be paid, and did not sue upon them. In 1962 the complainant learned that the mortgages which he had taken as security in the transaction were not first mortgages on the Knox Drive and Easy Street properties. These mortgages actually covered two vacant lots on which there were outstanding senior mortgages. On learning this, Pivowar signed a complaint charging the defendants with the crime of theft by false pretenses.\n\nOn appeal defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the information. They urge that a permanent taking of property must be proved in order to establish the crime of theft. Since the complainant had the right to sue on the defendants’ notes, the defendants assert that complainant cannot be said to have been deprived of his property permanently. Defendants misconceive the elements of the crime of theft by false pretenses.

A flexible pricing policy means that the price is bid or negotiated separately for each exchange. This is a common practice when selling to organizational markets where each transaction is typically quite large. In such cases, the buyer may initiate the process by asking for bidding on a product or service that meets certain specifications. Alternatively, a buyer may select a supplier and attempt to negotiate the best possible price. Marketing effectiveness in many industrial markets requires a certain amount of price flexibility.\n\nDiscounts and allowances\n\nIn addition to decisions related to the base price of products and services, marketing managers must also set policies related to the use of discounts and allowances. There are many different types of price reductions–each designed to accomplish a specific purpose.\n\nQuantity discounts are reductions in base price given as the result of a buyer purchasing some predetermined quantity of merchandise. A noncumulative quantity discount applies to each purchase and is intended to encourage buyers to make larger purchases. This means that the buyer holds the excess merchandise until it is used, possibly cutting the inventory cost of the seller and preventing the buyer from switching to a competitor at least until the stock is used. A cumulative quantity discount applies to the total bought over a period of time. The buyer adds to the potential discount with each additional purchase. Such a policy helps to build repeat purchases. Building material dealers, for example, find such a policy quite useful in encouraging builders to concentrate their purchase with one dealer and to continue with the same dealer over time. It should be noted that such cumulative quantity discounts are extremely difficult to defend if attacked in the courts.\n\nAD 1: A rebate can be very effective price discount\n\nSeasonal discounts are price reductions given or out-of-season merchandise. An example would be a discount on snowmobiles during the summer. The intention of such discounts is to spread demand over the year. This can allow fuller use of production facilities and improved cash flow during the year. Electric power companies use the logic of seasonal discounts to encourage customers to shift consumption to off-peak periods. Since these companies must have production capacity to meet peak demands, the lowering of the peak can lessen the generating capacity required.\n\nCash discounts are reductions on base price given to customers for paying cash or within some short time period. For example, a 2 per cent discount on bills paid within 10 days is a cash discount. The purpose is generally to accelerate the cash flow of the organization.\n\nTrade discounts are price reductions given to middlemen (e.g. wholesalers, industrial distributors, retailers) to encourage them to stock and give preferred treatment to an organization's products. For example, a consumer goo",

For example, one nation might have imposed very high tariffs (taxes on imports from other countries) while not taxing exports in order to encourage a favorable “balance of trade.” The balance of trade is an important statistic for many countries; for many years, the US balance of trade has been negative because it imports far more than it exports (even though the United States, with its very large farms, is the world’s largest exporter of agricultural products). This section will explore import and export controls in the context of the global agreement to reduce import controls in the name of free trade.\n\nExport Controls\n\nThe United States maintains restrictions on certain kinds of products being sold to other nations and to individuals and firms within those nations. For example, the Export Administration Act of 1985 has controlled certain exports that would endanger national security, drain scarce materials from the US economy, or harm foreign policy goals. The US secretary of commerce has a list of controlled commodities that meet any of these criteria.\n\nMore specifically, the Arms Export Control Act permits the president to create a list of controlled goods related to military weaponry, and no person or firm subject to US law can export any listed item without a license. When the United States has imposed sanctions, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) has often been the legislative basis; and the act gives the president considerable power to impose limitations on trade. For example, in 1979, President Carter, using IEEPA, was able to impose sanctions on Iran after the diplomatic hostage crisis. The United States still imposes travel restrictions and other sanctions on Cuba, North Korea, and many other countries.\n\nImport Controls and Free Trade\n\nNation-states naturally wish to protect their domestic industries. Historically, protectionism has come in the form of import taxes, or tariffs, also called duties. The tariff is simply a tax imposed on goods when they enter a country. Tariffs change often and vary from one nation-state to another. Efforts to implement free trade began with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and are now enforced through the World Trade Organization (WTO); the GATT and the WTO have sought, through successive rounds of trade talks, to decrease the number and extent of tariffs that would hinder the free flow of commerce from one nation-state to another. The theory of comparative advantage espoused by David Ricardo is the basis for the gradual but steady of tariffs, from early rounds of talks und",

We must be able to do this without separating the strands the infants have woven together” – Paola Cagliari\n\nExploring Documentation Options\n\nThere are many ways to record and document infant and toddler learning. Caregivers should utilize several methods as part of their regular documentation routines. The tools and strategies caregivers use to document force choices to be made: caregivers must take time to intentionally choose the best documentation tool for the intended communication. Infant and toddlers have the right to explain their creativity and their way of seeing the world. Caregivers must respect the different processes infants and toddlers use to build their knowledge and choose documentation with this in mind: it is crucial to find strategies to understand the processes of knowledge exploration and sustain, not suffocate, these processes (Cagliari, 2004).\n\nThe following methods are the most common for collecting and recording data:\n\nNarrative or Open Methods\n\n• Anecdotal notes\n• Running records\n• Daily log\n• Home-School Journal\n\nClosed Methods\n\n• Checklists\n• Frequency counts\n• Time or event samples\n\nAuthentic Documentation\n\n• Work samples\n• Taking photos, videotaping, or audio recordings\n\nAnecdotal Records\n\nAnecdotal records (sometimes referred to as specimen records) describe what infants and toddlers do and say. They are brief, focused notes about one event or incident from an infant or toddler's day. The key to creating an anecdotal record is to concentrate on one specific event or activity. When creating an anecdotal record, capturing the beginning, middle, and end of a particular event is often referred to as the ABCs.\n\nA= Antecedent: what happened before the event\n\nB= Behavior: the specific behavior being captured\n\nC= Consequence: what happened after the behavior\n\nAnecdotal records offer a window of opportunity into an infant or toddler’s actions, interactions, and reactions to people and events. When caregivers later analyze this collection of narratives, the anecdotal records can showcase an infant or toddler’s progress over time. (University of Washington, EarlyEdU Alliance, 2020).\n\nRunning Records\n\nThe primary goal for running records is to “obtain a detailed, objective account of behavior without inference, interpretations, or evaluations” (Bentzen, 2009, p.112). Running records contain many elements of an anecdotal record but go further than one specific narrative. The details recorded in a running record contain elements resembling an ethnography. An ethnography is the in-depth study of everyday practices of people's lives: it produces a detailed description of the studied group at a particular time and location. These descriptions document the behavior or cultural event in question and the context in which it occurs (Scheib et al., 2021). These elements can also be present in a running record",

That suggests it is made of two organs—and you may not even think of the spinal cord as an organ—but the nervous system is a very complex structure. Within the brain, many different and separate regions are responsible for many different and separate functions. It is as if the nervous system is composed of many organs that all look similar and can only be differentiated using tools such as the microscope or electrophysiology .\n\nWatch this video:\n\nA YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The central nervous system (CNS) is the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is everything else (see Figure 19.1). The brain is contained within the cranial cavity of the skull, and the spinal cord is contained within the vertebral cavity of the vertebral column. It is a bit of an oversimplification to say that the CNS is what is inside these two cavities and the peripheral nervous system is outside of them, but that is one way to start to think about it. In actuality, there are some elements of the peripheral nervous system that are within the cranial or vertebral cavities. The peripheral nervous system is so named because it is on the periphery—meaning beyond the brain and spinal cord. Depending on different aspects of the nervous system, the dividing line between central and peripheral is not necessarily universal.\n\nNervous tissue, present in both the CNS and PNS, contains two basic types of cells: neurons and glial cells.

The reader should be able to determine from the gel and its legend which plasmid is shown in each lane and which restriction endonuclease (RE) was used in each digest.\n\nMaterials and Methods: To reproduce your experiments, a reader will need to know which plasmids and REs that you used, how you purified the plasmids and some information about the agarose gels used for the restriction maps. When possible, refer to published procedures, noting any modifications to a published procedure. You may want to use subheadings for the M&M section.\n\nPlasmids: The MET genes and homologs have been cloned into two different yeast overexpression plasmids. Use the correct nomenclature when referring to plasmids of known genotypes. Plasmid names begin with a lower case “p” and are written in normal font. For much of this report, you will need to refer to the plasmids by their number alone, since you are still trying to identify them.\n\nPlasmid purification: There are many different methods for isolating plasmids, so inform the reader that you used the ZyppyTM Plasmid Mimiprep Kit (Zymo Research) with the modifications described in the lab manual. Include information on how you estimated plasmid DNA concentrations as well as the DNA concentration of each purified plasmid.\n\nRestriction digests: To reproduce your experiments, the reader will want to know how much plasmid DNA you used in the digestions and which REs you used. The ratio of RE units to DNA is important for successful digests. Your reader may be using a different commercial source of REs, so also provide the number of enzyme units (U) in the reaction. Do NOT list the μL of each component used in the reactions. Be sure to include information about the temperature and duration of the incubation.\n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis: See the guidelines for micro-report 2.\n\nResults and Discussion: Bring the reader through the logic for your experimental design. Why did you choose this particular RE? Refer to the bands on the gels as restriction fragments. Restriction fragments are the products of RE digestions.\n\nSize is very important in interpreting the results of a RE digest. A single summary data\ntable with the predicted and observed sizes of the restriction fragments should be included. Estimate the sizes of the restriction fragments by comparing their migration to the markers. Predicted sizes should very accurate, since they are based on the actual DNA sequences, which has nucleotide resolution. Your estimated sizes are much less accurate. You may be able to determine if one restriction fragment is smaller or larger than another, but you will only be able to place the fragments within a certain size range. NOTE: circular plasmids run anomalously on agarose gels. Supercoiled plasmids migrate mor",

The most fundamental property leading to periodic variations is the effective nuclear charge (Zeff). Because of the position of the diagonal line separating metals and nonmetals in the periodic table, the chemistry of groups 13, 14, and 15 is relatively complex.\n• 21.2: Group 1: The Alkali Metals\nLi, Na, K, Rb, and Cs are all group IA elements, also known as the alkali metals. The seventh member of the group, francium (Fr) is radioactive and so rare that only 20 atoms of Fr may exist on Earth at any given moment. The term alkali is derived from an Arabic word meaning “ashes.” Compounds of potassium as well as other alkali metals were obtained from wood ashes by early chemists.\n• 21.3: Group 2: The Alkaline Earth Metals\nGroup 2 elements almost exclusively form ionic compounds containing the M2+ ion, they are more reactive toward group 15 elements, and they have a greater tendency to form complexes with Lewis bases than do the alkali metals. Pure samples of most of the alkaline earth metals can be obtained by electrolysis of the chlorides or oxides. Beryllium was first obtained by the reduction of its chloride; radium chloride, which is radioactive, was obtained through a series of reactions and separations.\n• 21.4: Group 13: The Boron Family\nCompounds of the group 13 elements with oxygen are thermodynamically stable. Many of the anomalous properties of the group 13 elements can be explained by the increase in Zeff moving down the group. Isolation of the group 13 elements requires a large amount of energy because compounds of the group 13 elements with oxygen are thermodynamically stable. Boron behaves chemically like a nonmetal, whereas its heavier congeners exhibit metallic behavior.\n• 21.5: Group 14: The Carbon Family\nThe group 14 elements show the greatest diversity in chemical behavior of any group; covalent bond strengths decease with increasing atomic size, and ionization energies are greater than expected, increasing from C to Pb. The group 14 elements show the greatest range of chemical behavior of any group in the periodic table. Because the covalent bond strength decreases with increasing atomic size and greater-than-expected ionization energies due to an increase in Zeff.\n• 21.E: Exercises \n\n21: Chemistry of The Main-Group Elements I \n\nLearning Objectives\n• To know important periodic trends in several atomic properties.\n\nAs we begin our summary of periodic trends, recall that the single most important unifying principle in understanding the chemistry of the elements is the systematic increase in atomic number, accompanied by the orderly filling of atomic orbitals by electrons, which leads to periodicity in such properties as atomic and ionic size, ionization energy, electronegat",

Note that the motor is in the anode gate circuit in Figure below. This is correct, although it doesn’t look right. The anode lead is required to switch the SCS off. Therefore the motor cannot be in series with the anode.\n\nSCS: Motor start/stop circuit, an equivalent circuit with two transistors.\n\nWhen the “on” pushbutton switch is actuated, the voltage applied between the cathode gate and the cathode, forward-biases the lower transistor’s base-emitter junction, and turning it on. The top transistor of the SCS is ready to conduct, having been supplied with a current path from its emitter terminal (the SCS’s anode terminal) through resistor R2 to the positive side of the power supply. As in the case of the SCR, both transistors turn on and maintain each other in the “on” mode. When the lower transistor turns on, it conducts the motor’s load current, and the motor starts and runs. The motor may be stopped by interrupting the power supply, as with an SCR, and this is called natural commutation. However, the SCS provides us with another means of turning off: forced commutation by shorting the anode terminal to the cathode. [GE1] If this is done (by actuating the “off” pushbutton switch), the upper transistor within the SCS will lose its emitter current, thus halting current through the base of the lower transistor. When the lower transistor turns off, it breaks the circuit for base current through the top transistor (securing its “off” state), and the motor (making it stop). The SCS will remain in the off condition until such time that the “on” pushbutton switch is re-actuated.\n\nReview\n\n• A silicon-controlled switch, or SCS, is essentially an SCR with an extra gate terminal.\n• Typically, the load current through an SCS is carried by the anode gate and cathode terminals, with the cathode gate and anode terminals sufficing as control leads.\n• An SCS is turned on by applying a positive voltage between the cathode gate and cathode terminals. It may be turned off (forced commutation) by applying a negative voltage between the anode and cathodeterminals, or simply by shorting those two terminals together. The anode terminal must be kept positive with respect to the cathode in order for the SCS to latch.\n\n7.10: Field-effect-controlled Thyristors\n\nTwo relatively recent technologies designed to reduce the “driving” (gate trigger current) requirements of classic thyristor devices are the MOS-gated thyristor and the MOS Controlle",

Non-enveloped or “naked” animal viruses may enter cells in two different ways. When a protein in the viral capsid binds to its receptor on the host cell, the virus may be taken inside the cell via a vesicle during the normal cell process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. An alternative method of cell penetration used by non-enveloped viruses is for capsid proteins to undergo shape changes after binding to the receptor, creating channels in the host cell membrane. The viral genome is then “injected” into the host cell through these channels in a manner analogous to that used by many bacteriophages. Enveloped viruses also have two ways of entering cells after binding to their receptors: receptor-mediated endocytosis and fusion. Many enveloped viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis in a fashion similar to some non-enveloped viruses. On the other hand, fusion only occurs with enveloped virions. These viruses, which include HIV among others, use special fusion proteins in their envelopes to cause the envelope to fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell, thus releasing the genome and capsid of the virus into the cell cytoplasm.\n\nAfter making their proteins and copying their genomes, animal viruses complete the assembly of new virions and exit the cell. Using the example of HIV, enveloped animal viruses may bud from the cell membrane as they assemble themselves, taking a piece of the cell’s plasma membrane in the process. On the other hand, non-enveloped viral progeny, such as rhinoviruses, accumulate in infected cells until there is a signal for lysis or apoptosis, and all virions are released together.\n\nAnimal viruses are associated with a variety of human diseases. Some of them follow the classic pattern of acute disease, where symptoms worsen for a short period followed by the elimination of the virus from the body by the immune system with eventual recovery from the infection. Examples of acute viral diseases are the common cold and influenza. Other viruses cause long-term chronic ",

But what are philosophers? People who are “ready and willing to taste every kind of learning” and are “insatiable for it”; people who are “lovers of seeing the truth”; and above all, people who “are passionately devoted to and love the things with which knowledge deals,” the “forms.” What are these things seen and embraced by the philosophers, these forms? Socrates encourages us to consider one of them, “the beautiful itself.” Unlike “the many beautiful things” (this particular person, that particular song, etc.), which, depending upon one’s point of view, appear in some respects to be beautiful and yet in other respects ugly – or in fancy language, “partake in both being and not being” with respect to beauty – the beautiful itself “is” beautiful “completely.” People who fail to see and embrace the form of the beautiful may think they know what they are talking about when they say that this person is beautiful or that song is beautiful, but they have mere “belief”; only the person who grasps the form, who truly understands the nature of beauty, has “knowledge.” This is an early statement of a position that philosophers have come to call realism about universals. A modern day proponent of this view might explain it this way: Certain things exist, “universals” such as what it is to be beautiful, what it is to be green, what it is to be three in number, or what it is to be a knife. These things are capable, typically, of having “particular instances,” such as this beautiful face, that green leaf, those three pebbles, or the knife on the table, and it is in virtue of sharing a universal feature that particulars are correctly said to be similar. (Not that every universal must have instances: e.g., what it is to be a square circle, or what it is to be nonexistent.) Universals exist independent of their instances; what it is to be a dinosaur, for example, still exists even though dinosaurs don’t. Universals also exist independent of our minds; what it is to be a dinosaur existed before human beings ever imagined dinosaurs and will continue to exist should we ever cease to think about them. Finally, universals are the sort of thing that can be known, and to know such a thing is to understand the essence of an aspect of reality. With this topic we reach the midpoint of the Republic.\n\n• What would be an example of something you “believe” but don’t “know” (in Socrates’ sense of these terms)?\n\n• Suppose someone were to object that there are no such things as forms in Socrates’ sense of the term; there are of course words and phrases such as “beautiful,” “green,” “three in number,” “knife,” and “just,” but these are merely labels of our devising, manmade things that have no existence outside of the community of English speakers.

However, to use cycloalkanes in such applications, we must know the effects, functions, properties, and structures of cycloalkanes. Cycloalkanes are alkanes that are in the form of a ring; hence, the prefix cyclo-. Stable cycloalkanes cannot be formed with carbon chains of just any length. Recall that in alkanes, carbon adopts the sp3 tetrahedral geometry in which the angles between bonds are 109.5°. For some cycloalkanes to form, the angle between bonds must deviate from this ideal angle, an effect known as angle strain. Additionally, some hydrogen atoms may come into closer proximity with each other than is desirable (become eclipsed), an effect called torsional strain. These destabilizing effects, angle strain and torsional strain are known together as ring strain. The smaller cycloalkanes, cyclopropane and cyclobutane, have particularly high ring strains because their bond angles deviate substantially from 109.5° and their hydrogens eclipse each other. Cyclopentane is a more stable molecule with a small amount of ring strain, while cyclohexane is able to adopt the perfect geometry of a cycloalkane in which all angles are the ideal 109.5° and no hydrogens are eclipsed; it has no ring strain at all. Cycloalkanes larger than cyclohexane have ring strain and are not commonly encountered in organic chemistry.\n\nRing Strain and the Structures of Cycloalkanes\n\nThere are many forms of cycloalkanes, such as cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, among others. The process of naming cycloalkanes is the same as naming alkanes but the addition of the prefix cyclo- is required. Cyclobutane is in a form of a square, which is highly unfavorable and unstable (this will be explained soon). There are different drawings for cyclobutane, but they are equivalent to each other. Cyclobutane can reduce the ring string by puckering the square cyclobutane. Cyclopentane takes the shape of a pentagon and cyclohexane is in the shape of a hexagon.\n\nChair Conformation of Cyclohexane - Equitorial and Axial\n\nThere are two ways to draw cyclohexane because it can be in a hexagon shape or in a different conformational form called the chair conformation and the boat conformation.\n\n• The chair conformation drawing is more favored than the boat because of the energy, the steric hindrance, and a new strain called the transannular strain.\n• The boat conformation is not the favored conformation because it is less stable and has a steric repulsion between the two H's, shown with the pink curve. This is known as the transannular strain, which means that the strain results from steric crowding of two groups across a ring. The boat is less stable than the chair by 6.9 kcal/mol. The boat conformation, however, is flexible, and when we twist one of the C-C bonds, it reduces the transannular strain.\n• When we twist the C-C bond in a boat, it becomes a twisted boat.\n\nSome Conformations of",

                "source_content": "Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n• Explain the difference between the solar day and the sidereal day\n• Explain mean solar time and the reason for time zones\n\nThe measurement of time is based on the rotation of Earth. Throughout most of human history, time has been reckoned by positions of the Sun and stars in the sky. Only recently have mechanical and electronic clocks taken over this function in regulating our lives.\n\nThe Length of the Day\n\nThe most fundamental astronomical unit of time is the day, measured in terms of the rotation of Earth. There is, however, more than one way to define the day. Usually, we think of it as the rotation period of Earth with respect to the Sun, called the solar day. After all, for most people sunrise is more important than the rising time of Arcturus or some other star, so we set our clocks to some version of Sun-time. However, astronomers also use a sidereal day, which is defined in terms of the rotation period of Earth with respect to the stars.\n\nA solar day is slightly longer than a sidereal day because (as you can see from Figure) Earth not only turns but also moves along its path around the Sun in a day. Suppose we start when Earth’s orbital position is at day 1, with both the Sun and some distant star (located in the direction indicated by the long white arrow pointing left), directly in line with the zenith for the observer on Earth. When Earth has completed one rotation with respect to the distant star and is at day 2, the long arrow again points to the same distant star. However, notice that because of the movement of Earth along its orbit from day 1 to 2, the Sun has not yet reached a position above the observer. To complete a solar day, Earth must rotate an additional amount, equal to 1/365 of a full turn. The time required for this extra rotation is 1/365 of a day, or about 4 minutes. So the solar day is about 4 minutes longer than the sidereal day.\n\nBecause our ordinary clocks are set to solar time, stars rise 4 minutes earlier each day. Astronomers prefer sidereal time for planning their observations because in that system, a star rises at the same time every day.\n\nExample $1$: Sidereal time and solar time\n\nThe Sun makes a complete circle in the sky approximately every 24 hours, while the stars make a complete circle in the sky in 4 minutes less time, or 23 hours and 56 minutes. This causes the positions of the stars at a given time of day or night to change slightly each day. Since stars rise 4 minutes earlier each day, that works out to about 2 hours per month (4 minutes × 30 = 120 minutes or 2 hours). So, if a particular constellation rises at sunset during the winter, you can be sure that by the summer, it will rise about 12 hours earlier, with the sunrise, and it will not be so easily visible in the night sky. Let’s say that tonight the bright star Sirius rises at 7:00 p.m. from a given location so that by midnight, it is very high in the sky. At what time w",

Typically, the external frame is defined by the normal direction, the rolling direction, and the transverse direction in a sheet (ND, RD and TD respectively. Occasionally, CD meaning cross direction is used instead of TD.)\n\nThe animation below shows the relationship between the orientation of the crystal and the stereographic projection obtained for the <100> poles. Drag an atom in the green sphere to reorientate the unit cell of the grain under consideration. This will alter the projections of the [100], [010] and [001] directions on the stereogram inside the rectangle. Press 'Add grain' to add the [100], [010] and [001] directions of another grain, up to a maximum of four additional grains. Try altering their orientations so that all five are similar and then different, and notice how the positions of the poles change.\n\nA pole figure for a polycrystalline aggregate, which shows completely random orientation, does not necessarily appear as might naively be expected. Angular distortions inherent in the stereographic projection result in the accumulation of points close to the centre of the pole figure as shown in the image below.\n\nIf the material shows a degree of texture, the resultant pole figure will show the accumulation of poles about specific directions.\n\nA 100 pole figure showing “cube” texture – the {100} poles of the crystallites are oriented so that they are aligned with the axes defined by the rolling, transverse, and normal directions.\n\nA single crystal can be plotted on the pole figure and there is no ambiguity regarding its orientation. However, as more crystallite poles are plotted onto the pole figure, the specific orientation of a particular crystallite can no longer be defined.\n\nFor a large number of grains in a polycrystal, poles may overlap on the pole figure, so that the true orientation density is not clearly represented. In this case, contours tend to be used instead. Regions of high pole density have a high number of contours, while regions with low pole density have a few, greatly spaced contours.\n\n100 pole figure showing “cube” texture and pole density represented using contours rather than discrete points.\n\nInverse pole figures\n\nInstead of plotting crystal orientations with respect to an external frame of reference, inverse pole figures can be produced which show the rolling, transverse, and normal directions (RD, TD and ND respectively) with respect to the crystallographic axes.

Some common processes are those that involve finding a particular item in a given list of items, called searching. Another involves ordering items in a particular way of some given data, called sorting. The two represent a common application in computers where data has to be searched and retrieved. An example of an everyday application of this is in a telephone directory. It stores information such as the names, addresses and phone numbers of its customers. As the amount of information to be stored and accessed becomes very large, the computer comes in handy to assist in this task. To access the stored data, searching and sorting are carried out.\n\nKey Terms\n\n• Searching: the algorithmic finding of a particular item in a collection of given items\n• Sorting: the ordering of items in a given list\n\nLearning Activities\n\n• 4.1: Activity 1 - Searching Algorithm\nThis activity involves studying the searching process and how to write algorithms that can find a particular given item from a list of given items.

During starting, resistance may be placed in series with the rotor windings to limit starting current. If these windings are connected to a common starting resistance, the two rotors will remain synchronized during starting. (Figure below) This is useful for printing presses and draw bridges, where two motors need to be synchronized during starting. Once started, and the rotors are shorted, the synchronizing torque is absent. The higher the resistance during starting, the higher the synchronizing torque for a pair of motors. If the starting resistors are removed, but the rotors still paralleled, there is no starting torque. However there is a substantial synchronizing torque. This is a selsyn, which is an abbreviation for “self synchronous”.\n\nStarting wound rotor induction motors from common resistors.\n\nThe rotors may be stationary. If one rotor is moved through an angle θ, the other selsyn shaft will move through an angle θ. If drag is applied to one selsyn, this will be felt when attempting to rotate the other shaft. While multi-horsepower (multi-kilowatt) selsyns exist, the main application is small units of a few watts for instrumentation applications– remote position indication.\n\nSelsyns without starting resistance. Instrumentation selsyns have no use for starting resistors. (Figure above) They are not intended to be self rotating. Since the rotors are not shorted out nor resistor loaded, no starting torque is developed. However, manual rotation of one shaft will produce an unbalance in the rotor currents until the parallel unit’s shaft follows. Note that a common source of three phase power is applied to both stators. Though we show three phase rotors above, a single phase powered rotor is sufficient as shown in Figure below.\n\nTransmitter - receiver\n\nSmall instrumentation selsyns, also known as sychros, use single phase paralleled, AC energized rotors, retaining the 3-phase paralleled stators, which are not externally energized. (Figure below) Synchros function as rotary transformers. If the rotors of both the torque transmitter (TX) and torque receiver (RX) are at the same angle, the phases of the induced stator voltages will be identical for both, and no current will flow. Should one rotor be displaced from the other, the stator phase voltages will differ between transmitter and receiver. Stator current will flow developing torque. The receiver shaft is electrically slaved to the transmitter shaft. Either the transmitter or receiver shaft may be rotated to turn the opposite unit.\n\nSynchros have single phase powered rotors.\n\nSynchro stators are wound with 3-phase windings brought out to external terminals. The single rotor winding of a torque transmitter or receiver is brough out by brushed slip rings. Synchro transmitters and receivers are electrically identical.

                "source_content": "We can now apply the inverse function theory from the previous section to the exponential function. From Section 8.2, we know that the function $f(x) = b^x$ is either increasing (if b > 1) or decreasing (if 0 < b < 1), and therefore is one-to-one. Consequently, f has an inverse function $f^{−1}$.\n\nAs an example, let’s consider the exponential function $f(x) = 2^x$. f is increasing, has domain $D_{f} = (−\\infty, \\infty)$, and range $R_{f} = (0, \\infty)$. Its graph is shown in Figure 1(a). The graph of the inverse function $f^{−1}$ is a reflection of the graph of f across the line y = x, and is shown in Figure 1(b). Since domains and ranges are interchanged, the domain of the inverse function is $D_{f^{−1}} = (0, \\infty)$ and the range is $R_{f^{−1}} = (−\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nUnfortunately, when we try to use the procedure given in Section 8.4 to find a formula for $f^{−1}$, we run into a problem. Starting with $y = 2^x$, we then interchange x and y to obtain $x = 2^y$. But now we have no algebraic method for solving this last equation for y. It follows that the inverse of $f(x) = 2^x$ has no formula involving the usual arithmetic operations and functions that we’re familiar with. Thus, the inverse function is a new function. The name of this new function is the logarithm of x to base 2, and it’s denoted by $f^{−1}(x) = log_{2}(x)$.\n\nRecall that the defining relationship between a function and its inverse (Property 14 in Section 8.4) simply states that the inputs and outputs of the two functions are interchanged. Thus, the relationship between $2^x$ and its inverse $log_{2}(x)$ takes the following form:\n\n$v = log_{2}(u) \\longleftrightarrow u = 2^v$\n\nMore generally, for each exponential function $f(x) = b^x$ (b > 0, $b \\ne 1$), the inverse function $f^{−1}(x)$ is called the logarithm of x to base b, and is denoted by $log_{b}(x)$. The defining relationship is given in the following definition.\n\nDefinition $1$\n\nIf b > 0 and $b \\ne 1$, then the logarithm of u to base b is defined by the relationship\n\n$v = log_{b}(u) \\longleftrightarrow u = b^v$. (2)\n\nIn order to understand the logarithm function better, let’s work through a few simple examples.\n\nExample $3$\n\nCompute $log_{2}(8)$.\n\nAnswer\n\nLabel the required value by v, so $v = log_{2}(8)$. Then by (2), using b = 2 and u = 8, it follows that $2^v = 8$, and therefore v = 3 (solving by inspection).\n\nIn the last example, note that $log_{2}(8) = 3$ is the exponent v such that $2^v = 8$. Thus, in general, one way to interpret the definition of the logarithm in (2) is that $log_{b}(u)$ is the exponent v such that $b^v = u$. In other words, the value of the logarithm is the exponent!\n\nExample $4$\n\nCompute $log_{10}(10000)$.\n\nAnswer\n\nAgain, label the required value by v, so $v = log_{10}(10000)$. By (2), it follows that $10^v = 10 000$, and therefore v = 4. Note that here again we have found the exponent v = 4 that is needed for base 10 in order to get $10^v = 10 000$.\n\nExample $5$\n\nCompute $log_{3}(\\frac{1}{9})$",

Obviously if we know the formula, we can make an educated guess: something of the type ML6 will almost always be octahedral (there is an alternative geometry for 6-coordinate complexes, called trigonal prismatic, but it's pretty rare), whereas something of formula ML4 will usually be tetrahedral unless the metal atom has the d8 electron configuration, in which case it will probably be square planar. But what if we take a particular metal ion and a particular ligand? Can we predict whether it will form an octahedral or a tetrahedral complex, for example? To an extent, the answer is yes... we can certainly say what factors will encourage the formation of tetrahedral complexes instead of the more usual octahedral.\n\nThe Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) is the additional stabilization gained by the splitting of the orbitals according to the crystal field theory, against the energy of the original five degenerate d orbitals. So, for example, in a d1situation such as [Ti(OH2)6]3+, putting the electron into one of the orbitals of the t2g level gains -0.4 Δo of CFSE. Generally speaking, octahedral complexes will be favored over tetrahedral ones because:\n\n• It is more (energetically) favorable to form six bonds rather than four\n• The CFSE is usually greater for octahedral than tetrahedral complexes. Remember that Δo is bigger than Δtet (in fact, Δtet is approximately 4/9 Δo).\n\nIf we make the assumption that Δtet = 4/9 Δo, we can calculate the difference in stabilization energy between octahedral and tetrahedral geometries by referencing everything in terms of Δo.\n\nExample $1$: $d^3$ Stabilized Structures\n\nWhich is the preferred configuration for a d3 metal: tetrahedral or octahedral?\n\nSolution\n\nTo answer this, the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy has to be calculated for a $(d^3$ metal in both configurations. The geometry with the greater stabilization will be the preferred geometry.\n\n• For a d3 octahedral configuration, the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy is\n\n$3 \\times -0.4 \\Delta_o = -1.2 \\Delta_o \\nonumber$\n\n• For a d3 tetrahedral configuration (assuming high spin), the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy is\n\n$-0.8 \\Delta_{tet} \\nonumber$\n\nRemember that because Δtet is less than half the size of Δo, tetrahedral complexes are often high spin. We can now put this in terms of Δo (we can make this comparison because we're considering the same metal ion and the same ligand: all that's changing is the geometry)\n\nSo for tetrahedral d3, the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy is:\n\nCFSE = -0.8 x 4/9 Δo = -0.355 Δo.\n\nAnd the difference in Crystal Field Stabilization Energy between the two geometries will be:\n\n1.2 - 0.355 = 0.845 Δo.\n\nIf we do a similar calculation for the other configurations, we can construct a Table of Δo, Δtet and the difference between them (we'll ignore their signs since we're looking for the difference between them).\n\nTable $1$: Crystal Fie",

The activity of sorting ensures items in a given list are arranged in a desired order, say ascending or descending. The section involves studying insertion sort, shell sort, and quicksort algorithms.\n\nThe sorting algorithm\n\nA sorting algorithm is defined as an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most-used order is the alphabetical order, also known as the lexicographical order. Efficient sorting has the importance for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists. Examples of sorting algorithms include: insertion sort, shell sort and quick sort.\n\nInsertion sort is the simplest method, and does not require any additional storage. Shell sort is a simple modification that improves performance significantly. Quicksort is the most efficient and popular method, and is the method of choice for large arrays.\n\nInsertion Sort\n\nInsertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm, and which is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists. It can also be used as part of more sophisticated algorithms. It works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new sorted list. In an array structure, the new list and the remaining elements can share the array’s space, but insertion is expensive, requiring shifting all following elements over by one. The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into sorted sublist (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is no. of items.\n\nInsertion sort compares the first two elements:\n\nIt finds that both 14 and 33 are already in ascending order. For now, 14 is in sorted sub-list.\n\nInsertion sort moves ahead and compares 33 with 27.\n\nIt swaps 33 with 27. Also it checks with all the elements of sorted sublist. Here we see that sorted sub-list has only one element 14 and 27 is greater than 14. Hence sorted sub-list remain sorted after swapping.\n\nBy now we have 14 and 27 in the sorted sublist. Next it compares 33 with 10.\n\nThese values are not in sorted order.\n\nSo we swap them.\n\nBut swapping makes 27 and 10 unsorted.\n\nAgain we find 14 and 10 in unsorted order.\n\nAnd we swap them. By the end of third iteration we have a sorted sublist of 4 items.\n\nThis process goes until all the unsorted values are covered in sorted sublist. And now we shall see some programming aspects of insertion sort.\n\nExample of the insertion algorithm\n\nThe following are simple steps by which we can achieve insertion sort.\n\nStep 1 − If it is the first element, it is already sorted. return 1;\n\nStep 2 − Pick next element\n\nStep 3 − Compare with all elements in the sorted sub-list\n\nStep 4 − Shift all the elements in the sorted sub-l",

It turns out that there is no definitive answer to this question. Instead, it depends on circumstances. We illustrate this conclusion with a pair of exercises.\n\nThis exercise illustrates a much more general proposition: If a price discriminating monopolist produces less than a nondiscriminating monopolist, then price discrimination reduces welfare. This proposition has an elementary proof. Consider the price discriminating monopolist’s sales, and then allow arbitrage. The arbitrage increases the gains from trade, since every transaction has gains from trade. Arbitrage, however, leads to a common price like that charged by a nondiscriminating monopolist. Thus, the only way that price discrimination can increase welfare is if it leads a seller to sell more output than he or she would otherwise. This is possible, as the next exercise shows.\n\nIn Exercise 2, we see that price discrimination that brings in a new group of customers may increase the gains from trade. Indeed, this example involves a Pareto improvement: The seller and Group 2 are better off, and Group 1 is no worse off, than without price discrimination. (A Pareto improvement requires that no one is worse off and at least one person is better off.)\n\nWhether price discrimination increases the gains from trade overall depends on circumstances. However, it is worth remembering that people with lower incomes tend to have more elastic demand, and thus get lower prices under price discrimination than absent price discrimination. Consequently, a ban on price discrimination tends to hurt the poor and benefit the rich, no matter what the overall effect.\n\nA common form of price discrimination is known as two-part pricing. Two-part pricing usually involves a fixed charge and a marginal charge, and thus offers the ability for a seller to capture a portion of the consumer surplus. For example, electricity often comes with a fixed price per month and then a price per kilowatt-hour, which is two-part pricing. Similarly, long distance and cellular telephone companies charge a fixed fee per month, with a fixed number of “included” minutes, and a price per minute for additional minutes. Such contracts really involve three parts rather than two parts, but are similar in spirit.\n\nFigure 15.2 Two-part pricing\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n• If a price discriminating monopolist produces less than a nondiscriminating monopolist, then price discrimination reduces welfare.\n• Price discrimination that opens a new, previously unserved market increases welfare.\n• A ban on price discrimination tends to hurt the poor and benefit the rich, no matter what the overall effect.\n• Two-part pricing involves a fixed charge and a marginal charge.\n• The ideal two-part price is to charge marginal cost plus a fixed charge equal to the customer’s consumer surplus, in which case the seller captures the entire gai",

In this CPU, the values of the \\$ac and \\$pc, which store the current state of the CPU, are implemented as a group of 16 flip flops. These components are circled in red in Figure 11.1.1. Without flip flops, it would be impossible to maintain the state of the CPU, and the CPU could not do any useful work.\n\nThe number of registers in a CPU varies widely between the types of CPU, and even within a CPU itself. A more normal Accumulator CPU would have several more registers, such as a Memory Access Register (\\$mar), and a temporary register (\\$temp).\n\n11.03: Muxes\n\nWhen designing a CPU, muxes seem to pop up everywhere. They are the most used building block in a CPU, and most larger ICs. In the CPU presented in Figure 11.1.1, each mux is circled in blue, the following muxes are used.\n\n1. There is a mux before the \\$pc register to select if the next sequential instruction in the memory is to be used, or if the program should branch to a non-adjacent instruction.\n2. There is a mux before the ALU to select if the ALU operand will be retrieved from memory, or if the operand should be taken from the instruction itself.\n3. There is a mux before the \\$ac register that determines if the instruction is to set the value of the \\$ac to 0, or if the value to be stored in the \\$ac comes from the ALU.\n\n11.04: Adder\n\nThe ALU is the part of the CPU that implements operations, such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, OR, AND, shift, etc. The adder in this text was presented as an exemplar of an operation which would be done in the ALU. In this ALU, there is an ALUOpt control bus that consists of 4 wires, which can specify up to 16 operations. Only 4 operations are implemented in this ALU, integer add, sub, multiply, and divide. All 4 operations are calculated all the time, but only one result is ever returned, and that result is selected by an ever ubiquitous mux.\n\n11.05: Decoder\n\nOther than the fact that a decoder is present in a mux, the decoder is only present in this CPU in the CU. In the CU the decoder is used to break down the 4 bit input into the actual operations that the CPU is to perform. These operations are then combined to set the correct control wires for the CPU to perform this operation.\n\n11.06: Summary\n\nThis text was written to help students and hobbyists to understand what an IC is, and to give them some of the most basic ICs and shown how they can be implemented using only AND, OR, NOT, NAD, and XOR gates. By actually implementing the ICs using a bread board and chips, the circuits were more concrete ideas rather than fuzzy concepts.\n\nHowever up until this last chapter, the usefulness of these gates in larger ICs was not covered. This chapter showed how to use these simple building blocks could create an IC which has potential to implement useful hardware.",

Academic writing gives us the chance to join a worldwide conversation about what is true on every subject under the sun.\n\nTo many, academic writing seems elitist.  In the past, it certainly was controlled by the people in power in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and wealth.  It amplified the voices of the elites.  But it can empower any of us. Academic writing offers ways for anyone who struggles in society to find a voice.\n\nJust as there are many ways to respond when a friend tells us something, there are many ways to respond in writing to a written argument. We don’t have to have all the answers; there are many ways to contribute without being experts.  In this chapter, we lay out various options for response. By making these moves, we can help move the larger discussion toward greater insight.\n\nUses in college, work, and life\n\nMany college writing assignments call for responses that go beyond agreeing or disagreeing with an argument. The response can be a place to bring in opinion and personal experience as they relate to the argument. Even if an assessment assignment doesn’t specifically ask for a recommendation, it often makes sense to add one to a conclusion. Whether we agreed or disagreed with the argument, pointing toward a next step for the larger conversation on the issue can give the essay a sense of momentum and purpose.\n\nThe response moves described in this chapter are not just for academic writing.  They can also help us respond to classmates’ work in live discussions or online comments on other people’s posts. They’re key in professional settings too; we often need to respond to an argument such as a proposal, a memo, or a case study and show that we have something to add. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, etc all encourage responses; we read a post and then add our own comment as we react, reply, share, or retweet. Of course email, texting, messageboards, forums, blogs and some news media also invite original commentary. Practicing academic response writing, then, can enrich our repertoire of responses in everyday life.\n\n5.02: Maybe.  We need to know       - Call for More Information\n\nMedia Alternative\n\nList",

                "source_content": "The Mechanism of Action of β-Lactam Antibiotics\n\nAntibiotics are specific chemical substances derived from or produced by living organisms that are capable of inhibiting the life processes of other organisms. The first antibiotics were isolated from microorganisms but some are now obtained from higher plants and animals. Over 3,000 antibiotics have been identified but only a few dozen are used in medicine. Antibiotics are the most widely prescribed class of drugs comprising 12% of the prescriptions in the United States. The penicillins were the first antibiotics discovered as natural products from the mold Penicillium.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming, professor of bacteriology at St. Mary's Hospital in London, was culturing Staphylococcus aureus. He noticed zones of inhibition where mold spores were growing. He named the mold Penicillium rubrum. It was determined that a secretion of the mold was effective against Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nPenicillins as well as cephalosporins are called beta-lactam antibiotics and are characterized by three fundamental structural requirements: the fused beta-lactam structure (shown in the blue and red rings, a free carboxyl acid group (shown in red bottom right), and one or more substituted amino acid side chains (shown in black). The lactam structure can also be viewed as the covalent bonding of pieces of two amino acids - cysteine (blue) and valine (red).\n\nPenicillin-G where R = an ethyl pheny group, is the most potent of all penicillin derivatives. It has several shortcomings and is effective only against gram-positive bacteria. It may be broken down in the stomach by gastric acids and is poorly and irregularly absorbed into the blood stream. In addition many disease producing staphylococci are able to produce an enzyme capable of inactivating penicillin-G. Various semisynthetic derivatives have been produced which overcome these shortcomings.\n\nPowerful electron-attracting groups attached to the amino acid side chain such as in phenethicillin prevent acid attack. A bulky group attached to the amino acid side chain provides steric hindrance which interferes with the enzyme attachment which would deactivate the pencillins i.e. methicillin. Refer to Table 2 for the structures. Finally if the polar character is increased as in ampicillin or carbenicillin, there is a greater activity against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nPenicillin Mode of Action\n\nAll penicillin derivatives produce their bacteriocidal effects by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Specifically, the cross linking of peptides on the mucosaccharide chains is prevented. If cell walls are improperly made cell walls allow water to flow into the cell causing it to burst. Resemblances between a segment of penicillin structure and the backbone of a peptide chain have been used to explain the mechanism of action of beta-lactam antibiotics. The structures of a beta-lactam antibiotic and a peptide are shown on the left for comparison. Follow t",

                "source_content": "The Apgar assessment is conducted one minute and five minutes after birth. This is a very quick way to assess the newborn's overall condition. Five measures are assessed: Heart rate, respiration, muscle tone (assessed by touching the baby's palm), reflex response (the Babinski reflex is tested), and color. A score of 0 to 2 is given on each feature examined. An Apgar of 5 or less is cause for concern. The second Apgar should indicate improvement with a higher score.\n\nAnother way to assess the condition of the newborn is the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). The baby's motor development, muscle tone, and stress response are assessed. This tool has been used around the world to further assess the newborn, especially those with low Apgar scores, and to make comparisons of infants in different cultures (Brazelton & Nugent, 1995).\n\nProblems of the Newborn\n\nAnoxia: Anoxia is a temporary lack of oxygen to the brain. Difficulty during delivery may lead to anoxia which can result in brain damage or in severe cases, death. Babies who suffer both low birth weight and anoxia are more likely to suffer learning disabilities later in life as well.\n\nLow Birth weight: We have been discussing a number of teratogens associated with low birth weight such as alcohol, tobacco, etc. A child is considered low birth weight if he or she weighs less than 5 pounds 8 ounces (2500 grams). About 8.2 percent of babies born in the United States are of low birth weight (Center for Disease Control, 2015a). A low birth weight baby has difficulty maintaining adequate body temperature because it lacks the fat that would otherwise provide insulation. Such a baby is also at more risk for infection, and 67 percent of these babies are also preterm which can make them more at risk for respiratory infection. Very low birth weight babies (2 pounds or less) have an increased risk of developing cerebral palsy. Many causes of low birth weight are preventable with proper prenatal care.\n\nPreterm: A newborn might also have a low birth weight if it is born at less than 37 weeks gestation, which qualifies it as a preterm baby (CDC, 2015c). Early birth can be triggered by anything that disrupts the mother's system. For instance, vaginal infections can lead to premature birth because such infection causes the mother to release anti-inflammatory chemicals which, in turn, can trigger contractions. Smoking and the use of other teratogens can lead to preterm birth. A significant consequence of preterm birth includes respiratory distress syndrome, which is characterized by weak and irregular breathing (United States National Library of Medicine, 2015).\n\nSmall-for-Date Infants: Infants that have birth weights that are below expectation based on their gestational age are referred to as small-for-date. These infants may be full term or preterm, but still weigh less than 90 % of all babies of the same gestational age. This is a very serious situation for newborns as their growth was adversely affec",

You will practice your listening skills by watching a Spanish instructor describe a member of her “familia” and then by watching and responding to the presentations of two peers.\n\nTask: This activity has four parts:\n\nPart 1. Watch a Spanish instructor introduce and describe her “family member and pet.”\n\nPart 2. Use a computer or a smartphone to record a short video in which you describe a “family member(s)” in Spanish (if you make mistakes, it is okay and expected; start over from the beginning of the sentence and keep recording). This can be a real family member or a pretend family member. You will need to have a visual prop (photo, etc.) of this family member(s) that is visible in your video as you describe them in Spanish.\n\nPart 3. Watch the video presentations of two of your peers and respond with one follow up question in Spanish.\n\nPart 4. Answer the questions your peers posed to you about your original video post, thank them, and sign off.\n\nCriteria: The components of this activity add up to 100%.\n\nParts 1 & 2. Watch the video example of a Spanish instructor introducing and describing her “family member and pet.” Record your own video introducing and describing a “family member(s)” in Spanish (if you make mistakes, it is okay and expected; start over from the beginning of the sentence and keep recording). You and the visual prop of this family member(s) will need to be visible in the video. You must use at least 7 descriptive adjectives (5 % each/ 35% total) and you must identify the family member’s relationship to you (25%).\n\nPart 3. Choose two peers and watch their presentations. After watching your your peers’ presentations, record and upload one follow up question about the family member who you “met” in the video. The follow up is worth 20%.\n\nPart 4. Answer the questions your peers asked you about the person(s) or pet(s) you presented as a family member. Record a unique response to each peer as a video comment, than",

                "source_content": "LEARNING OBJECTIVE\n\n1. Understand that a person who signs commercial paper incurs contract liability.\n2. Recognize the two types of such liability: primary and secondary.\n3. Know the conditions that must be met before secondary liability attaches.\n\nTwo types of liability can attach to those who deal in commercial paper: contract liability and warranty liability. Contract liability is based on a party’s signature on the paper. For contract liability purposes, signing parties are divided into two categories: primary parties and secondary parties.\n\nWe discuss here the liability of various parties. You may recall the discussion in Chapter 22 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\" about accommodation parties. An accommodation party signs a negotiable instrument in order to lend his name to another party to the instrument. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) provides that such a person “may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser” and that in whatever capacity the person signs, he will be liable in that capacity.Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-419.\n\nLiability of Primary Parties\n\nTwo parties are primarily liable: the maker of a note and the acceptor of a draft. They are required to pay by the terms of the instrument itself, and their liability is unconditional.\n\nMaker\n\nBy signing a promissory note, the maker promises to pay the instrument—that’s the maker’s contract and, of course, the whole point to a note. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the note or to an indorser that paid the note.Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-412.\n\nAcceptor\n\nRecall that acceptance is the drawee’s signed engagement to honor a draft as presented. The drawee’s signature on the draft is necessary and sufficient to accept, and if that happens, the drawee as acceptor is primarily liable. The acceptance must be written on the draft by some means—any means is good. The signature is usually accompanied by some wording, such as “accepted,” “good,” “I accept.” When a bank certifies a check, that is the drawee bank’s acceptance, and the bank as acceptor becomes liable to the holder; the drawer and all indorsers prior to the bank’s acceptance are discharged. So the holder—whether a payee or an indorsee—can look only to the bank, not to the drawer, for payment.Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-414(b). If the drawee varies the terms when accepting the draft, it is liable according to the terms as varied.Uniform Commercial Code, Section 3-413(a)(iii).\n\nLiability of Secondary Parties\n\nUnlike primary liability, secondary liability is conditional, arising only if the primarily liable party fails to pay. The parties for whom these conditions are significant are the drawers and the indorsers. By virtue of UCC Sections 3-414 and 3-415, drawers and indorsers engage to pay the amount of an unaccepted draft to any subsequent holder or indorser who takes it up, again, if (this is the conditional part) the (1) the instrument is dishonored and, in some cases, (",

                "source_content": "Now $r_{\\pi}$, the equivalent small signal resistance of the base-emitter diode, is given simply by the inverse of the conductance of the equivalent diode. Remember, we found $\\begin{array}{l} r_{\\pi} &= \\frac{1}{\\frac{q}{kT} I_{B}} \\ &= \\frac{1}{\\frac{q}{kT} \\frac{I_{C}}{\\beta}} \\ &= \\frac{\\beta}{40 I_{C}} \\end{array} \\nonumber$\n\nwhere we have used the fact that $I_{C} = \\beta I_{B}$ and $\\frac{q}{kT} = 40 \\mathrm{~V}^{-1}$. As we said earlier, typical values for $\\beta$ in a standard bipolar transistor will be around $100$. Thus, for a typical collector bias current of $I_{C} = 1 \\mathrm{~mA}$, $r_{\\pi}$ will be about $2.5 \\mathrm{~k} \\Omega$.\n\nThere is one more item we should consider in putting together our model for the bipolar transistor. We did not get things completely right when we drew the common emitter characteristic curves for the transistor. There is a somewhat subtle effect going on when $V_{\\text{CE}}$ is increased. Remember, we said that the current coming out of the collector is not effected by how big the drop was in the reverse biased base-collector junction. The collector current just depends on how many electrons are injected into the base by the emitter, and how many of them make it across the base to the base-collector junction. As the base-collector reverse bias is increased (by increasing $V_{\\text{CE}}$) the depletion width of the base-collector junction increases as well. This has the effect of making the base region somewhat shorter. This means that a few more electrons are able to make it across the base region without recombining, and as a result $\\alpha$ and hence $\\beta$ increase somewhat. This then means that $I_{C}$ goes up slightly with increasing $V_{\\text{CE}}$. The effect is called base width modulation. Let us now include that effect in the common emitter characteristic curves. As you can see in Figure $3$, there is now a slope to the $I_{C} \\left(V_{\\text{CE}}\\right)$ curve, with $I_{C}$ increasing somewhat as $V_{\\text{CE}}$ increases. The effect has been somewhat exaggerated in Figure $2$, and I will now make the slope even bigger so that we may define a new quantity, called the Early Voltage.\n\nBack in the very beginning of the transistor era, an engineer at Bell Labs, Jim Early, predicted that there would be a slope to the $I_{C}$ curves, and that they would all project back to the same intersection point on the horizontal axis. Having made that prediction, Jim went down into the lab, made the measurement, and confirmed his prediction, thus showing that the theory of transistor behavior was being properly understood. The point of intersection of the $V_{\\text{CE}}$ axis is known as the Early Voltage. Since the symbol $V_{E}$, for the emitter voltage, was already taken, they had to label the Early Voltage $V_{A}$ instead. (Even though the intersection point in on the negative half of the $V_{\\text{CE}}$ axis, $V_{A}$ is universally quoted as a positive number.)\n\nHow can we model the sloping $I \\text{-} V",

The football play diagrammed above describes the lineup of each player on the team and describes how they will move when the ball is snapped. Diagrams of electrons give similar information about where certain electrons are. We can mark these electrons and indicate what happens to them when an element reacts.\n\nElectron Dot Diagrams\n\nRecall that the valence electrons of an atom are the electrons located in the highest occupied principal energy level. Valence electrons are primarily responsible for the chemical properties of elements. The number of valence electrons can be easily determined from the electron configuration. Several examples from the second period elements are shown in the table below.\n\nTable \\(1\\):\n\nElement Electron Configuration Number of Valence Electrons\nlithium \\(1s^2 \\: 2s^1\\) 1\nberyllium \\(1s^2 \\: 2s^2\\) 2\nnitrogen \\(1s^2 \\: 2s^2 \\: 2p^3\\) 5\nneon \\(1s^2 \\: 2s^2 \\: 2p^6\\) 8\n\nIn each case, valence electrons are those in the second principal energy level. As one proceeds left to right across a period, the number of valence electrons increases by one. In the \\(s\\) block, Group 1 elements have one valence electron, while Group 2 elements have two valence electrons. In the \\(p\\) block, the number of valence electrons is equal to the group number minus ten. Group 13 has three valence electrons, Group 14 has four, and so on...up through Group 18 with eight. The eight valence electrons, a full outer \\(s\\) and \\(p\\) sublevel, give the noble gases their special stability.\n\nWhen examining chemical bonding, it is necessary to keep track of the valence electrons of each atom. Electron dot diagrams are diagrams in which the valence electrons of an atom are shown as dots distributed around the element's symbol. A beryllium atom, with two valence electrons, has the electron dot diagram below:\n\nSince electrons repel each other, the dots for a given atom are distributed evenly around the symbol before they are paired. The table below shows the electron dot diagrams for the entire second period.\n\nTable \\(2\\): Electron Dot Diagrams for the Second Period Elements\n\nElectron Dot Diagrams for the Second Period Elements\nGroup Number Electron Dot Diagram\n1\n2\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\nElectron dot diagrams would be the same for each element in the representative element groups. Most transition elements have two valence electrons, though some that have unusual electron configurations have only one.\n\nSummary\n\n• Electron dot diagrams show the valence electrons for an atom.\n• The dot diagrams are the same for each element in the representative element groups.\n\nReview\n\n1.

                "source_content": "The term polarizability refers to the tendency of molecules to generate induced electric dipole moments when subjected to an electric field. It originates from the fact that nuclei and electrons are generally not fixed in space and that when molecules are subject to an electric field, the negatively charged electrons and positively charged atomic nuclei are subject to opposite forces and undergo charge separation. Polarizability allows us to better understand the interactions between nonpolar atoms and molecules and other electrically charged species, such as ions or polar molecules with dipole moments.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNeutral nonpolar species have spherically symmetric arrangements of electrons in their electron clouds. When in the presence of an electric field, their electron clouds can be distorted (Figure $1$). The ease of this distortion is the polarizability of the atom or molecule. The created distortion of the electron cloud causes the originally nonpolar molecule or atom to acquire a dipole moment. This induced dipole moment is related to the polarizability of the molecule or atom and the strength of the electric field by the following equation:\n\n$μ_{ind} = \\alpha E \\label{1}$\n\nwhere $E$ denotes the strength of the electric field and $\\alpha$ is the polarizability of the atom or molecule with units of C m2V-1.\n\nIn general, polarizability correlates with the interaction between electrons and the nucleus. The amount of electrons in a molecule affects how tight the nuclear charge can control the overall charge distribution. Atoms with fewer electrons will have smaller, denser electron clouds, as there is a strong interaction between the few electrons in the atoms’ orbitals and the positively charged nucleus. There is also less shielding in atoms with fewer electrons contributing to the stronger interaction of the outer electrons and the nucleus. With the electrons held tightly in place in these smaller atoms, these atoms are typically not easily polarized by external electric fields. In contrast, large atoms with many electrons, such as negative ions with excess electrons, are easily polarized. These atoms typically have very diffuse electron clouds and large atomic radii that limit the interaction of their external electrons and the nucleus.\n\nFactors that Influence Polarizability\n\nThe relationship between polarizability and the factors of electron density, atomic radii, and molecular orientation is as follows:\n\n1. The greater the number of electrons, the less control the nuclear charge has on charge distribution, and thus the increased polarizability of the atom.\n2. The greater the distance of electrons from nuclear charge, the less control the nuclear charge has on the charge distribution, and thus the increased polarizability of the atom.\n3. Molecular orientation with respect to an electric field can affect polarizability (labeled Orientation-dependent), except for molecules that are: tetrahedral, octahedral or icosahedral (labeled Orient",

Chlorine, on the other hand, has more electrons and is smaller, but its electron cloud is more tightly bound, making it less polarizable. This shows how the distance of electrons from the nucleus and their binding energy also play crucial roles. Now, I understand the concept of polarizability better. Thank you so much for the help.",

There are two different stator coils. The 1.0 inch wide 3200 turn L2 winding is shown in the illustration above (b), wound over a section of 5.1-inch diameter plastic 3-liter soda bottle. L1 is approximately 3800 turns of #33 AWG (American wire gauge) enameled magnet wire wound over a 1.25 width of a section of a soda bottle, wider than shown at (b). Mark a 1.25-inch wide cylinder with 0.25-inch margins on each end. The wire will be wound on the 1.25-inch zone. The form is cut from the bottle on the outside edges of the margin. Cuts of 0.25 inch from the margin to the winding zone are spaced at 1-inch intervals around the circumference of both ends so that the margin may be bent up at 90o to hold the wire on the form. To avoid counting the 3800 turns, scramble wind a 1/8 inch thickness of magnet wire over the one-inch width of the form. Else, count the turns. Scrape the enamel from 1-inch on the free end, and scrape only a small section from the lead to the spool. Do NOT cut the lead to the spool. Measure the resistance, and estimate how much more wire to wind to achieve 894 Ω. Apply enamel, nail polish, tape, or other insulation to the bare spot on the spool lead. Continue winding, and recheck the resistance. Once the approximate 894 Ω is achieved, leave a few inches of magnet wire for the lead. Cut the lead from the spool. Secure the windings to the form with lacing twine or other means.\n\nThe L1 winding of 3200 turns is approximately 744 Ω and is wound on a 1.0-inch wide form as shown at (b) in a manner similar to the previous L2 winding.\n\nStrip the enamel off 1-inch of the ends of magnet wire leads if not already done. Splice the bare ends to heavier gauge insulated hook-up wire. Solder the splice. Insulate with tape or heat-shrink tubing. Secure the splice to the coil body. Then proceed with the second coil. The coils may be mounted in one corner of the wooden base. Alternatively, for more flexibility in use, they may be mounted to movable pallets.\n\nRefer to both the schematic diagram and the illustration for assembly. Note that the coils are mounted at right angles. L2, the smaller coil is wired to both sides of the 120 Vac line. The capacitor is wired in series with the wider coil L1. The capacitor provides a leading phas",

                "source_content": "An aqueous solution is one that is occurring in water. What makes water significant is that it can allow for substances to dissolve and/or be dissociated into ions within it.\n\nElectrolytes\n\nWater is generally the solvent found in aqueous solution, where a solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. The solute is the substance or compound being dissolved in the solvent. A solute has fewer number of particles than a solvent, where it's particles are in random motion. Interestingly, aqueous solutions with ions conduct electricity to some degree. Pure water, having a very low concentration of ions, cannot conduct electricity. When a solute dissociates in water to form ions, it is called an electrolyte, due to the solution being a good electrical conductor. When no ions are produced, or the ion content is low, the solute is a non-electrolyte. Non-electrolytes do not conduct electricity or conduct it to a very small degree. In an aqueous solution a strong electrolyte is considered to be completely ionized, or dissociated, in water, meaning it is soluble. Strong acids and bases are usually strong electrolytes. A weak electrolyte then is considered to be one that is not completely dissociated, therefore still containing whole compounds and ions in the solution. Weak acids and bases are generally weak electrolytes. In other words, strong electrolytes have a better tendency to supply ions to the aqueous solution than weak electrolytes, and therefore strong electrolytes create an aqueous solution that is a better conductor of electricity.\n\n• Most soluble ionic compounds and few molecular compounds are strong electrolytes.\n• Most molecular compounds are weak or non electrolytes.\nExample $1$\n\nHere's an example of MgCl2 in water:\n\n$MgCl_2 \\rightarrow Mg^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2Cl^-_{(aq)} \\nonumber$\n\nThe ionic compound dissociates completely to form ions in water, therefore, it is a strong electrolyte.\n\nNow let's look at a weak electrolyte:\n\n$HC_2H_3O_2(aq) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + C_2H_3O_2^-(aq) \\nonumber$\n\nThe ionic compound, $HC_2H_3O_2$ in this situation, only partially dissociates, as expressed by the double arrows in the reaction. This means that the reaction is reversible and never goes to completion.\n\nThe $H^+$ cation is a proton that interacts with the $H_2O$ molecules that it is submerged in. The interaction is called hydration. The actual H+ ion does not exist in the aqueous solution. It is the hydronium ion, $H_3O^+$ that interacts with water to create additional species like $H_5O_2^+$, $H_9O_4^+$, and $H_7O_3^+$. $H_3O^+$ can simply be described as the hydration of one H+ and one water molecule. For nonelectrolytes, all that needs to be done is write the molecular formula because no reaction or dissociation occurs. One example of a nonelectrolyte is sugar: written as $C_6H_{12}O_6 (aq)$.\n\nIon Concentrations\n\nIn an aqueous solution the amount of ions of a species is related to the number of moles of that species per concentration of the substa",

                "source_content": "Consciousness describes our awareness of internal and external stimuli. Awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our thoughts and emotions. Awareness of external stimuli includes seeing the light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, and hearing the voice of a friend. We experience different states of consciousness and different levels of awareness on a regular basis. We might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep. Sleep is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakeful- ness. Wakefulness is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness, thought, and behavior. Between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming, intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use, meditative states, hypnotic states, and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation. We might also experience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes. Often, we are not completely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake. For instance, have you ever daydreamed while driving home from work or school without really thinking about the drive itself? You were capable of engaging in the all of the complex tasks involved with operating a motor vehicle even though you were not aware of doing so. Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology.\n\n9.02: Biological Rhythms\n\nBiological rhythms are internal rhythms of biological activity. A woman’s menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm—a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes. One complete menstrual cycle takes about 28 days—a lunar month—but many biological cycles are much shorter. For example, body temperature fluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period (Figure \\(1\\)). Alertness is associated with higher body temperatures, and sleepiness with lower body temperatures.\n\nThis pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one example of a circadian rhythm. A circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours. Our sleep-wake cycle, which is linked to our environment’s natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body temperature. Some circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.\n\nIf we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of biological clock? In the brain, the hypothalamus, which lies above the pituitary gland, is a main center of homeostasis. Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system.\n\nThe brain’s clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

Extraordinary displays of resistance and courage take place in Juárez every day[1]. Since the 2008 conference, “Missing Women: Decolonization, Third Wave Feminism, and Indigenous People of Canada and Mexico,” at the First Nations University of Canada and the University of Regina, violence has overwhelmed Juárez and forever changed it. Fear, death, and devastation characterized the city and surrounding region from 2006 to roughly 2012, in what journalist Kent Patterson has simply called the ‘Great Violence.’ Although the feminicides[2] that made Juárez infamous continued across the state of Chihuahua, they were overshadowed by this greater violence, as headlines of macabre killings linked to cartel violence made international headlines. The fighting was principally fueled by drug violence as feuding Mexican rivals—the Juárez and Sinaloa cartels—fought for control of the plazas, the lucrative clandestine corridors used to transport drugs across the U.S. border.\n\nThen Mexican President Felipe Calderón launched a war on drugs that mirrored the failing war on drugs that the U.S. has fought and defended for over forty years. The U.S. enthusiastically supported Calderón’s drug war in Mexico but failed to take a critical stance, outside of progressive circles, on the colossal U.S. consumer drug market that contributes to an estimated \\$426 to \\$652 billion worldwide drug industry (Tharook 2017). The appetite for drugs in the U.S. has driven much of the bloodshed that came to broadly depict life in Juárez and across regions of Mexico. It directly led to the now more than 100,000 deaths and over 30,000 disappearances that have resulted from the Mexican war on drugs and its lingering aftermath (www.mileno.com). Many experts argue that the carnage has not dissipated since 2006 and that the above numbers should be doubled to accurately depict the total number of deaths. Since 2006, violence ensued at a feverish pace and government officials responded with an unbridled military and policing force that only exacerbated human rights atrocities, assaults, disappearances, kidnappings, and deaths. Chihuahua state authorities, along with the Mexican military, were accused of large-scale systemic corruption, impunity, and human rights violations. For example, between 2007 and 2009, in an operation called Operativo Conjunto Chihuahua, President Calderón deployed 5,000 troops to fight drug cartels and street violence, such as kidnappings, car jackings, extortion schemes, robberies, and drug cartel murders (Bejarano and Morales 2011).\n\nDuring the ‘Great Violence,’ people were equally fearful of cartels and corrupt law enforcement at both the federal and state level, and they remained terrified of the rising tide of street level crimes.

Consider two sets of orthogonal axes, $\\text{O}x, \\text{O}y$, and $\\text{O}x^\\prime, \\text{O}y^\\prime$, such that one set makes an angle $θ$ with respect to the other. See figure (a) below. $\\text{A}$ point $\\text{P}$ can be described either by its coordinates $(x,y)$ with respect to one \"basis set\" $\\text{O}x, \\text{O}y$, or by its coordinates with respect to the other basis set $\\text{O}x^\\prime, \\text{O}y^\\prime$. The question is, what is the relation between the coordinates $(x,y)$ and the coordinates $(x^\\prime,y^\\prime)$? See figure $\\text{III.18}$.\n\nWe see that $\\text{OA} = x, \\ \\text{AP} = y, \\ \\text{ON} = x^\\prime, \\ \\text{PN} = y^\\prime, \\ \\text{OM} = x \\cos θ, \\ \\text{MN} = y \\sin θ$,\n\n$\\therefore \\quad x^\\prime = x \\cos θ + y \\sin θ. \\label{3.6.1} \\tag{3.6.1}$\n\nAlso $\\text{MA} = \\text{NB} = x \\sin θ, \\quad \\text{PB} = y \\cos θ,$\n\n$\\therefore \\quad y^\\prime = -x \\sin θ + y \\cos θ. \\label{3.6.2} \\tag{3.6.2}$\n\nThese two relations can be written in matrix form as\n\n$\\pmatrix{x^\\prime \\ y^\\prime} = \\pmatrix{\\cos θ & \\sin θ \\ -\\sin θ & \\cos θ} \\pmatrix{x \\ y}. \\label{3.6.3} \\tag{3.6.3}$\n\n$\\text{FIGURE III.18}$\n\nThere are several ways of obtaining the converse relations; that is, Equations for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $x^\\prime$ and $y^\\prime$. One way would be to design drawings similar to (b) and (c) that show the converse relations clearly, and the reader is encouraged to do this. Another way is merely to solve the above two Equations (which can be regarded as two simultaneous Equations in $x$ and $y$) for $x$ and $y$. Less tedious is to interchange the primed and unprimed symbols and change the sign of $θ$. Perhaps the quickest of all is to recognize that the determinant of the matrix\n\n$\\pmatrix{\\cos θ & \\sin θ \\ -\\sin θ & \\cos θ}$\n\nis unity and therefore the matrix is an orthogonal matrix. One important property of an orthogonal matrix M is that its reciprocal M$^{−1}$ is equal to its transpose $\\tilde{\\textbf{M}}$ (formed by transposing the rows and columns). Therefore the converse relation that we seek is\n\n$\\pmatrix{x \\ y} = \\pmatrix{\\cos θ & \\sin θ \\ - \\sin θ & \\cos θ}^{-1} \\pmatrix{x^\\prime \\ y^\\prime} = \\pmatrix{\\cos θ & -\\sin θ \\ \\sin θ & \\cos θ} \\pmatrix{x^\\prime \\ y^\\prime}. \\label{3.6.4} \\tag{3.6.4}$\n\nThe reader might like to try all four methods to ensure that they all arrive at the same result.\n\n3.07: Rotation of Axes Three Dimensions.

Rather, we have simply assumed that they produce constant voltage through some sort of mysterious process. Here, we will explore that process to some degree and cover some of the practical considerations involved with real batteries and their use in power systems.\n• 11.2: Battery Construction\nThe word battery simply means a group of similar components. In military vocabulary, a “battery” refers to a cluster of guns. In electricity, a “battery” is a set of voltaic cells designed to provide greater voltage and/or current than is possible with one cell alone.\n• 11.3: Battery Ratings\nBecause batteries create electron flow in a circuit by exchanging electrons in ionic chemical reactions, and there is a limited number of molecules in any charged battery available to react, there must be a limited amount of total electrons that any battery can motivate through a circuit before its energy reserves are exhausted. Battery capacity could be measured in terms of total number of electrons, but this would be a huge number. We could use the unit of the coulomb (equal to 6.25 x 1018 ele\n• 11.4: Special-purpose Batteries\nBack in the early days of electrical measurement technology, a special type of battery known as a mercury standard cell was popularly used as a voltage calibration standard. The output of a mercury cell was 1.0183 to 1.0194 volts DC (depending on the specific design of cell), and was extremely stable over time. Advertised drift was around 0.004 percent of rated voltage per year. Mercury standard cells were sometimes known as Weston cells or cadmium cells.\n• 11.5: Practical Considerations - Batteries\nWhen connecting batteries together to form larger “banks” (a battery of batteries?), the constituent batteries must be matched to each other so as to not cause problems. \n\n11: Batteries And Power Systems \n\nIn the first chapter of this book, the concept of an atom was discussed, as being the basic building-block of all material objects. Atoms, in turn, are composed of even smaller pieces of matter called particles. Electrons, protons, and neutrons are the basic types of particles found in atoms. Each of these particle types plays a distinct role in the behavior of an atom. While electrical activity involves the motion of electrons, the chemical identity of an atom (which largely determines how conductive the material will be) is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus (center).\n\nThe protons in an atom’s nucleus are extremely difficult to dislodge, and so the chemical identity of any atom is very stable. One of the goals of the ancient alchemists (to turn lead into gold) was foiled by this sub-atomic stability. All efforts to alter this property of an atom by means of heat, light, or friction were met with failure. The electrons of an atom, however, are much more easily dis",

                "source_content": "So far we have talked only about individual atoms or molecules, and about masses measured in atomic mass units. But individual molecules are hard to manipulate in the laboratory, and chemists weigh their materials in grams, not in atomic mass units. To scale up from the molecular level to the laboratory level, we use a unit called a mole. A mole of a substance is equal to as many molecules of that substance as there are atoms of carbon-12 in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. This means that 1 mole of any substance is a weight, in grams, equal to that substance's molecular weight expressed in atomic mass units. Most important of all, by this definition, 1 mole of any substance contains the same number of molecules. The chemist can count atoms and molecules in the laboratory simply by weighing them. The word mole applies not just to molecules but also to atoms; in practice, we speak of a mole of helium atoms as well as of a mole of water molecules. The term gram-atom applied to a mole of atoms is no longer widely used.\n\nExample 1.5.1\n\nHow many grams of each of the following substances are there in 1 mole of that substance: H2, H20 , CH3OH, octane (C8H18), and neon gas (Ne)?\n\nSolution\n\nThe molecular weights (in atomic mass units) of most of these substances have been given in previous examples, and the atomic weight of neon is listed on the inside back cover. One mole of each substance is therefore:\n\nH2 2.0160 g break C8H18 114.23 g\nH2O 18.0154 g break Ne 20.179 g\nCH3OH 32.04 g break\n\nBecause the weights listed in Example 9 give the correct relative weights of the molecules that are being weighed out, each of the quantities of material will contain the same number of molecules. This is what makes the concept of moles useful. It is not even necessary to know what that number is, although we know it to be 6.022 X 1023 ; it is called Avogadro's number and is given the symbol N Going from molecules to moles means a scale-up of 6.022 X 1023 times. Avogadro's number is also the conversion factor between atomic mass units and grams as units of mass: 1 g = 6.022 X 1023 amu. If we think of the molecular weight as being the mass of a mole of substance, the units for molecular weight are grams per mole; if we think of it as the actual weight of one molecule, the numerical value is unchanged but the units become atomic mass units per molecule. Both are correct.\n\nExample 1.5.2\n\nOne molecule of H2 reacts with one molecule of Cl2 to form two molecules of hydrogen chloride gas, HCl. What weight of chlorine gas should be used in order to react completely with 1 kilogram (kg) of hydrogen gas?\n\nSolution\n\nThe molecular weights of H2 and Cl2 are 2.0160 g mole-1 and 70.906 g mole-1, respectively. * Hence 1000 g of H2 contains:\n\n$\\textstyle\\frac{1000 g}{2.0160 g mole^-1}$ = 496.0 moles of H2 molecules\nWithout knowing how many molecules there are in a mole, we can still be sure that 496.0 moles of Cl2 will have the same number of molecules as 496.0 moles or 1000 g of H2.

                "source_content": "In the previous section, we looked at four individual works that can each be understood to express something about national identity. All four of these works, however, belong generally to the tradition of Western art music. When Liszt and Bartók wrote for solo piano, they contributed to the repertoire for pianists trained in the classical style. When Dvořák and Beach composed symphonies, they adhered to norms developed by two centuries of European composers. In other cases, however, entirely new musical traditions come to represent a nation’s identity. Such traditions have unique characteristics and practices, and sometimes unique instruments as well. They become inextricably linked with national identity on an international level and can serve to further the political interests of a nation. Such is the case with the tradition of steelband music, which developed in and came to represent the nation of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\n9.11: Steelband Music of Trinidad and Tobago\n\nLike South Africa, the nation of Trinidad and Tobago is largely defined by its colonial past. The modern nation consists of two islands (Trinidad is the larger, Tobago the smaller). These islands were first claimed as a Spanish colony in 1498. The invaders rewrote the demographics of the region, essentially eradicating the indigenous population while bringing vast numbers of enslaved Africans overseas to work in the agricultural sector. For this reason, citizens of African descent now make up about 40% of the population.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, Spain struggled to supply enough settlers to oversee its island’s industries. To this end, in 1783 the Spanish King invited French settlers to take over agricultural lands on the islands, resulting in French cultural influence. In 1797, however, the British took military control of Trinidad and Tobago, and the islands remained part of the British empire until independence in 1962.\n\nAs a result of British colonialism, English is the official language of Trinidad and Tobago, although most residents speak a creolized form that reflects the influence of several African languages. However, citizens of British descent make up only a small portion of the population. Following the abolition of slavery in 1838, Indian immigrants came to the islands as indentured laborers. Today, their descendants also make up about 40% of the population. Trinidad and Tobago, therefore, is a diverse nation in which African, Indian, and European influence can be discerned in everyday life.\n\nThe vestiges of Catholicism—brought centuries ago by Spanish and French colonists—will be central to our discussion. Although only a fifth of the nation’s population identify as Catholic today, one Catholic tradition in particular continues to have a major impact on the music of Trinidad and Tobago: Carnival. We discussed Carnival elsewhere in Chapter 4, for it played a significant role in the development of opera. Diverse Carnival traditions have arisen around the world in t",

What are the processes associated with people coming to leadership positions?\n\nLeadership is a process, a complex and dynamic exchange relationship built over time between leader and follower and between leader and the group of followers who depend on each other to attain a mutually desired goal.10 There are several key components to this \"working relationship\": the leader, the followers, the context (situation), the leadership process per se, and the consequences (outcomes) (see Exhibit 12.3).11 Across time, each component interacts with and influences the other components, and whatever consequences (such as leader-follower trust) are created influence future interactions. As any one of the components changes, so too will leadership.12\n\nThe Leader\n\nLeaders are people who take charge of or guide the activities of others. They are often seen as the focus or orchestrater of group activity, the people who set the tone of the group so that it can move forward to attain its goals. Leaders provide the group with what is required to fulfill its maintenance and task-related needs. (Later in the chapter, we will return to the “leader as a person” as part of our discussion of the trait approach to leadership.)\n\nThe Follower\n\nThe follower is not a passive player in the leadership process. Edwin Hollander, after many years of studying leadership, suggested that the follower is the most critical factor in any leadership event.13 It is, after all, the follower who perceives the situation and comes to define the needs that the leader must fulfill. In addition, it is the follower who either rejects leadership or accepts acts of leadership by surrendering his power to the leader to diminish task uncertainty, to define and manage the meaning of the situation to the follower, and to orchestrate the follower’s action in pursuit of goal attainment.\n\nThe follower’s personality and readiness to follow determine the style of leadership that will be most effective. For example, individuals with an internal locus of control are much more responsive to participative styles of leadership than individuals with an external locus of control.14 Individuals with an authoritarian personality are highly receptive to the effectiveness of directive acts of leadership.15 It is the followers' expectations, as well as their performance-based needs, that determine what a leader must do in order to be effective.\n\nThe strength of the follower’s self-concept has also been linked to the leadership process. High-self-esteem individuals tend to have a strong sense of self-efficacy, that is, a generalized belief they can be successful in difficult situations. They therefore tend to be strongly motivated to perform and persist in the face of adversity.16 The high-self-esteem follower tends to be responsive to participative styles of leadership. Low-self-esteem individuals, who doubt their competence and worthiness and their ability to succeed in difficult situations, function better with sup",

The practice of code switching is a deeply explored topic in Angie Thomas’s realistic-fiction novel, The Hate You Give, which revolves around Starr Carter; a teenage, African-American girl who witnesses the death of a childhood friend at the hands of a police officer. Among Starr’s many struggles is her connection to two vastly different lives which she believes must be separated until events cause her to come to grips with who she really is. In today’s America, the practice of code switching is very apparent for a surplus of reasons, but when relating to our youth, the action is more commonly performed in instances that allow them to fit in, hide something or as an inadvertent action. The Hate You Give is able to express why teens feel it is necessary for teens to code switch when they are a part of what feels like two different worlds.\n\nThe Hate You Give is able to accurately portray why a teenager such as Starr may feel the need to code switch among different groups of people to escape judgement and the feeling of being inferior. Starr Carter was removed from her intercity schooling at Garden Heights by her parents at age ten when her friend Natasha was killed in a drive by shooting. Starr was enrolled at Williamson Prep where she began a new life, with new friends while still being a part of her intercity roots. Throughout the story, Starr will repeatedly refer to herself as either, “Garden Heights Starr” or “Williamson Starr”, because she believes she must be two different people if she wants to fit in with the two different groups that are most prevalent in her life. A specific instance of Starr’s code switching is her vocabulary which changes depending on the Starr she is trying to be. For example, when Starr is around her Garden Heights friends as well as her family, she will use words like “ain’t”, “gonna” and “finna” which is very common language for people living in Garden Heights. These words are a contrast to Williamson Starr who is frequently making sure to talk and act like that of her mostly white peers and so that her “ghetto accent” isn’t noticed by her friends and boyfriend. To many American teens, it is difficult to fit in especially when bullying and cyberbullying are at an all-time high. In a study conducted by Stage of Life, 95% of students surveyed said to have felt inferior in some way, shape or form and in order for many teens to fit in, they feel the need to change something about themselves that can somehow make them seem less inferior to their peers and we see Starr perform this action because of her fear of being judged by her friends for being an intercity girl.\n\nAmerican teens today are very concerned with hiding aspects of their lives that may lead to people thinking les",

How might you apply these ideas to your own experience or practice?\n\nAnswer\n\nAlthough the concept of anti-oppressive practice is highly contested, Burke and Harrison argue that (social work) practitioners have ‘a moral, ethical and legal responsibility to challenge inequality and disadvantage.’ They remark that anti-oppressive practice is a ‘dynamic process based on the changing complex patterns of social relations.’ They use the definition of anti-oppressive practice espoused by Clifford, who uses the term ‘anti-oppressive’:\n\nto indicate an explicit evaluative position that constructs social divisions (especially ‘race’, class, gender, disability, sexual orientation and age) as matters of broad social structure, at the same time as being personal and organisational issues. It looks at the use and abuse of power not only in relation to individual or organisational behaviour, which may be overtly, covertly or indirectly racist, classist, sexist and so on, but also in relation to broader social structures for example, the health, educational, political and economic, media and cultural systems and their routine provision of services and rewards for powerful groups at local as well as national and international levels. These factors impinge on people's life histories in a unique way that have to be understood in their socio-historical complexity. -Clifford, 1995, p. 65\n\nIn considering how you could apply anti-oppressive principles to your own work, you would need to think about the following.\n\n• Social differences and understanding how they interconnect and overlap.\n• Linking the personal and the political, particularly when examining and trying to assess individual life experiences.\n• Addressing power and powerlessness.\n• Locating events within a historical and geographical perspective.\n• Practising reflexivity and mutual involvement.\n\nOne of the driving forces of anti-oppressive practice is being able to challenge inequality and recognise that challenges are not always successful and may be very painful both for the person or group being challenged and for those who are challenging. One important aspect of challenging inequality is being self-aware and understanding how your own social location affects the communication between yourself and the individual or group you may be challenging. The process of thinking and reflecting is a core part of working in an anti-oppressive way.\n\nBurke and Harrison offer the following set of challenges for people wanting to work in an anti-oppressive way which:\n\n• is flexible without losing focus\n• includes the views of oppressed individuals and groups\n• is theoretically informed\n• challenges and changes existing ideas and practices\n• analyses the oppressive nature of organisational culture and its impact on prac",

                "source_content": "Imagine a tree as a metaphor for a cultural system—all the things that make up who you are. The roots of a tree are essential for the survival of the tree. They carry the nutrients needed for the growth of the tree and store nutrients for later feeding. Roots of trees are generally located in the top 6 to 24 inches of the ground, not too deep from the surface. The roots are impacted by their surrounding, and environmental factors contribute to their health and vitality.\n\nJust like the roots on a tree, cultural systems have roots that are impacted by their surroundings. A culture’s rituals, traditions, ceremonies, myths, and symbols provide it with the nutrients it needs to survive. Environmental factors can change a tree by uprooting it or letting it die off, making space for new life in its place. Similarly, environmental changes impact cultural systems, forcing it to adapt and change to its surroundings or transition into death, creating new cultural stories that carry new life.\n\nBut unlike trees and their roots, we get stuck in our cultural systems and do not budge even when our surroundings have changed. Trees, like anything in an ecosystem, have natural cycles of renewal and rebirth. Sometimes this renewal and rebirth is gradual and gentle, while other times it is fast, disruptive, and violent. Trees, because they share their environments with others, will learn to adapt and allow change to occur, no matter what the direction of change may be. Change in their cultural environments is inevitable and a part of the life cycle.\n\nIn similar ways, we can think about our cultural systems as part of a larger system. Some cultural anthropologists would describe the cultural systems as “big C” (macroculture) and “little C” (microculture). The macroculture refers to a larger cultural system, for example, Catholicism is a culture that is not bounded by geography. Within the macroculture of Catholicism are smaller units of culture called subcultures. Change is constant in each cultural system, and transitions, renewal, and rebirth are endless cycles. As cultural shifts occur in the macro- and microcultures, small and large, gradual and disruptive, the entire system learns to adapt in different ways.\n\n2.02: What is Culture\n\nDefinitions of culture cover a wide range of perspectives. When I ask participants in my business workshops to describe culture, the following are words and phrases they use: food, religion, language, music, region or geography, ethnicity, clothes, and so on. Generally, there is always one person who raises his or her hand timidly and says, “I think culture is more than that. It’s the things we don’t see, like our beliefs or views about gender.” Both are correct—culture represents the things we see, the tangible, as well as the intangible things.\n\nFigure 2.1 Iceberg Metaphor\n\nThe iceberg, a commonly used metaphor to describe culture, is a great example for illustrating the tangible and the intangible.

The polarization of the electromagnetic wave is meant to describe the magnitude and the direction of the electric field of the wave. Specifically, the polarization of a radiated wave is defined as \"that property of a radiated electromagnetic wave describing the time-varying direction and relative magnitude of the electric field vector; the trace and magnitude of the electric field vector are observed in the direction of light propagation\"1,2,\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe polarization of electromagnetic wave (EMW) is the basic property of the EMW, which is widely used and controlled in Laser3,4, interferometer5,6 and photography7. The sketch for the linear polarization (red curves) of EMW is shown in Fig.1 below.\n\nbased on the Maxwell equations9 for EMW, the electric field can be split into orthogonal x-component Exand y-component Ey10 :\n\nwhere Ex is the magnitude of the electric field in x-direction, Ey is the magnitude of the electric field in x-direction, Phix is the phase of the electric field in x-direction, Phiy is the phase of the electric field in y-direction and omega is the frequency of the EMW. The three major polarization state are defined based on the differences in phase and magnitude of x-direction and y-direction EMW.\n\nLinear Polarization\n\nAssume Ey in the mathematical expression for the electric field equals to zero, which gives the definition of electric field as:\n\nThe electric field on certain propagation position will oscillate only on the x-axis with the angular frequency of omega, which is shown as below:\n\nFig.2 x-axis linear polarization12\n\nThus, the similar polarization of electric field on only a specific straight direction is defined as linear polarization. On the other hand, Assume Ey equals to zero, which gives the electric field as:\n\nThe electric field only oscillate on the y-axis with the angular frequency of omega, which is shown in Fig.3:\n\nFig. 3 y-axis linear polarization13\n\nGenerally, with x-direction oscillation and y-direction oscillation share the same phase, the linear polarization field pattern can be express as:\n\nthe angle of the linear oscillation towards the x-axis is calculated as:\n\nThe polarization sketch is shown in Fig. 4:\n\nFig. 4 general linear polarization14\n\nCircular Polarization\n\nThe circular polarization state is a special polarization state of elliptical polarization state, which satisfies the following conditions: 1) The field must have two orthogonal polarized components (such as x-direction and y-direction). 2) The two components mist have the same magnitude (Ex = Ey), 3) The two components must have a time-phase difference of multiples of 90 degrees. Thus the field pattern can be written as:\n\nAnd the polarization pattern can be drawn as Fig.4 and Fig.5:\n\nFig.5 left circular polarization15 Fig.6 right circular polarization16\n\nthe left ",

To compensate for this, the traveler begins to hyperventilate, trying to expel excess carbon dioxide and bring pH back to normal. However, if the traveler stays at high altitude, it may take several days for their pH to fully return to normal.\n\nAcid-Base Disorders\n\nAcid-base imbalance is an abnormality of the human body’s normal balance of acids and bases that causes the plasma pH to deviate out of normal range (7.35 to 7.45). In the fetus, the normal range differs based on which umbilical vessel is sampled (umbilical vein pH is normally 7.25 to 7.45; umbilical artery pH is normally 7.18 to 7.38). Acid-base imbalances can exist in varying levels of severity, some life-threatening.\n\nAn excess of acid is called acidosis and an excess in bases is called alkalosis. The process that causes the imbalance is classified based on the etiology of the disturbance (respiratory or metabolic) and the direction of change in pH (acidosis or alkalosis).\n\nMixed disorders may feature an acidosis and alkalosis excess at the same time that partially counteract each other, or there can be two different conditions affecting the pH in the same direction. The phrase mixed acidosis, for example, refers to metabolic acidosis in conjunction with respiratory acidosis.\n\nMetabolic Acidosis\n\nIn medicine, metabolic acidosis is a condition that occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. If unchecked, metabolic acidosis leads to acidemia, that is, blood pH is less than 7.35 due to increased production of hydrogen by the body, or because of the body’s inability to form bicarbonate (HCO3-) in the kidneys.\n\nAcidosis refers to a low pH in tissue. Acidemia refers to a low pH in the blood. Symptoms may include chest pain, palpitations, headache, altered mental status such as severe anxiety due to hypoxia, decreased visual acuity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, altered appetite (either loss of or increased) and weight loss (longer term), muscle weakness, and bone pains.\n\nRapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled, thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels, resulting in some degree of compensation. Overcompensation via respiratory alkalosis to form an alkalemia does not occur.\n\nNeurological complications include lethargy, stupor, coma, seizures. Cardiac complications include arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia) and decreased response to epinephrine; both lead to hypotension (low blood pressure).\n\nMetabolic Alkalosis\n\nMetabolic alkalosis is a metabolic condition in which the pH of tissue is elevated beyond the normal range (7.35 to 7.45). This is the result of decreased hydrogen ion concentration, leading to increased bicarbonate concentration, or as a direct result of increased b",

Think of your paragraphs as links in a chain where coherence and continuity are key. Imagine reading one long block of text, with each idea blurring into the next. You are likely to lose interest in a piece of writing that is disorganized and spans many pages without breaks. Paragraphs separate ideas into logical, manageable chunks, each paragraph focusing on only one main idea and presenting coherent sentences to support that one point. Because all the sentences in one paragraph support the same point, a paragraph may stand on its own. For most types of informative or persuasive academic writing, writers find it helpful to think of the paragraph analogous to an essay, as each is controlled by a main idea or point, and that idea is developed by an organized group of more specific ideas. Thus, the thesis of the essay is analogous to the topic sentence of a paragraph, just as the supporting sentences in a paragraph are analogous to the supporting paragraphs in an essay.\n\nIn essays, each supporting paragraph adds another related main idea to support the writer’s thesis, or controlling idea. Each related supporting idea is developed with facts, examples, and other details that explain it. By exploring and refining one idea at a time, writers build a strong case for their thesis. Effective paragraphing makes the difference between a satisfying essay that readers can easily process and one that requires readers to mentally organize the piece themselves. Thoughtful organization and development of each body paragraph leads to an effectively focused, developed, and coherent essay.\n\nAn effective paragraph contains three main parts:\n\n• a topic sentence\n• body, supporting sentences\n• a concluding sentence\n\nIn informative and persuasive writing, the topic sentence is usually the first or second sentence of a paragraph and expresses its main idea, followed by supporting sentences that help explain, prove, or enhance the topic sentence. In narrative and descriptive paragraphs, however, topic sentences may be implied rather than explicitly stated, with all supporting sentences working to create the main idea. If the paragraph contains a concluding sentence, it is the last sentence in the paragraph and reminds the reader of the main point by restating it in different words.\n\nCreating Focused Paragraphs with Topic Sentences\n\nThe foundation of a paragraph is the topic sentence which expresses the main idea or point of the paragraph. A topic sentence functions in two ways: it clearly refers to and supports the essay’s thesis, and it indicates what will follow in the rest of the paragraph. As the unifying sentence for the paragraph, it is the most general sentence, whereas all supporting sentences provide different types of more specific information such as facts, details, or examples.\n\nAn effective topic sentence has the following characteristics:\n\n• A topic sentenc",

Health disparities adversely affect groups of people who often experience greater obstacles to health based on individual characteristics, such as socioeconomic status, age, gender, culture, religion, mental illness, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.[2]\n\nExamples of vulnerable populations are[3],[4]:\n\n• The very young and the very old\n• Individuals with chronic illnesses, disabilities, or communication barriers\n• Veterans\n• Racial and ethnic minorities\n• Individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ)\n• Victims of human trafficking or sexual violence\n• Individuals who are incarcerated and their family members\n• Rural Americans\n• Migrant workers\n• Individuals with chronic mental health disorders\n• Homeless people\n\nIndividuals typically have less access and use of health services, resulting in significant health disparities in life expectancy, morbidity, and mortality. They are also more likely to have one or more chronic physical and/or mental health illnesses.[5] Advancing health equity for all members of our society is receiving increased emphasis as a central goal of public health. Health equity is defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as the “attainment of the highest level of health for all people” and that “achieving health equity requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal efforts to address avoidable inequities, historical and contemporary injustices, and the elimination of health and health care disparities.”[6]\n\nExamples of vulnerable populations and associated resources available to promote health equity and reduce health disparities are further described in the following sections.\n\nAge and Developmental Status\n\nDevelopmental status and age are associated with vulnerability. Children have health and developmental needs that require age-ap",

There are three major classifications of acids and bases: (1) The Arrhenius definition states that an acid produces H+ in solution and a base produces OH- and the (2) Brønsted-Lowry and (3) Lewis definitions of acids and bases. Of particular importance in inorganic chemistry is the \"hard and soft (Lewis) acids and bases\" (HSAB) theory that is widely used for explaining stability of compounds, reaction mechanisms, and reaction pathways. \n\n03: Acid-Base Chemistry \n\nAcids and bases are important for a number reasons in inorganic chemistry.\n\n• Many industrially useful catalytic reactions involve inorganic acids and superacids, such as zeolites, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and sulfated zirconia. These acids are sufficiently strong in anhydrous media that they can protonate olefins and alcohols to produce carbocations. Carbocations are key intermediates in the transformations of hydrocarbons.\n• Inorganic compounds are sometimes synthesized in strongly acidic or basic media. For example, ternary metal oxides can be synthesized and crystallized in molten NaOH or KOH, which are strongly basic. Organic fluorination reactions are often done in strongly acidic media, such as anhydrous HF. Understanding the familiar chemistry of acids and bases in water helps us understand how these non-aqueous media work.\n• The acidic or basic environment of metal ions affects the stability of their oxidation states. We will learn more about this in Chapter 4.\n• Transition metal complexes (coordination compounds and organometallic compounds) are essentially Lewis acid-base complexes. We can understand a great deal about their stability and reactivity by considering the acid-base character of metals and ligands. We will learn about this in Chapter 5.\n\nSolid acid catalysts, such as zeolite Y, are used to isomerize hydrocarbons in the processing of crude oil into gasoline.

Catalysts and catalysis are addressed in this section and the other aspects of chemical production are addressed in Sections 13.13 and 13.14.\n\nAn ideal green chemical reaction occurs with 100% atom efficiency using only reactants and no other reagents under mild conditions with only moderate input of thermal energy and without any catalysts. Unfortunately, few chemical processes meet these criteria.\n\nIn the past, especially in the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals where the objective has been to simply make the desired product without much consideration of waste, so-called stoichiometric reagents have been used. These have included inorganic oxidants such as MnO2, KMnO4, K2Cr2O7; metal reductants including zinc, magnesium, sodium, and iron; and metal hydride reducing agents, especially LiAlH4 and NaBH4. Various organic reactions including sulfonations and nitrations employ Lewis acids (BF3, AlCl3, ZnCl2) and mineral acids (HF, H2SO4, and H3PO4). Many of these processes are indirect methods of adding to organic molecules hydrogen (reduction), oxygen (oxidation), carbon, and nitrogen. A problem with these reagents is the large amount of inorganic wastes produced. Where possible, it is much more desirable to employ catalysts to attach the simplest possible forms of the elements including H2 for reduction, O2 or H2O2 for oxidation, CO or CO2 for attachment of carbon, and NH3 for attachment of N.\n\nInstead of relying only on stoichiometric reagents, catalysts are commonly employed. As discussed in Chapter 5, Section 5.5, catalysts, are substances that enable reactions to proceed at significant rates without themselves being consumed. Catalysts are of great importance in the practice of green chemistry for a number of reasons including their ability to facilitate reactions and to reduce the energy required to enable reactions to proceed. There are two major approaches to contacting catalyst with a reaction mixture as shown in Figure 13.4. In heterogeneous catalysis the catalyst is held on a support and the reactants flow over it. In homogeneous catalysis the\n\ncatalyst is placed in the reaction mixture and either remains in the product or is separated from the product in a separate step. In general, homogeneous catalysts have high activity and selectivity whereas heterogeneous catalysts are more easily recovered and recycled. Much of the activity in green chemistry has been in the area of catalysis, especially in the development of heterogeneous catalysts that do not contaminate the product and that can be reused multiple times. Large numbers of different catalysts are used in chemical processes and their potential toxicities, production of byproducts and contaminants, recycling, and disposal are matters of considerable importance in the chemical industry.\n",

This book spurred on interest in the sciences to examine the microscopic world using lenses but is also notable for Hooke’s observations of cork where he used the word “cell” in a biological sense for the first time.\n\nThe Father of Microbiology: van Leeuwenhoek\n\nThe Dutch tradesman Antonie van Leeuwenhoek used high power magnifying lenses to examine the parts of insects and to examine the quality of fabric in his drapery business. He began to experiment with pulling glass to generate lenses and developed a simple microscope to observe samples. Using a simple single lens with a specimen mounted on a point, he was able to identify the first microscopic “animalcules” (little animals) that will be later known as protozoa (original animals).\n\nThough van Leeuwenhoek’s apparatus was simple, the magnifying power of his lenses and his curiosity enabled him to perform great scientific observations on the microscopic world. He was ridiculed for fabricating his observations of protists at first. Ever the scientist, van Leeuwenhoek examined samples of his own diarrhea to discover Giardia intestinalis. While he did not make the connection of the causative nature of this microorganism, he described the details of the way this organism could propel itself through the medium in great detail.\n\nModern Compound Microscope\n\nUnlike van Leeuwenhoek’s single-lens microscope, we now combine the magnifying power of multiple lenses in what is called a compound microscope.\n\n1. Ocular lens or eyepiece\n2. Nose Piece/ Lens Carousel\n3. Objective lens\n4. Course Focus Knob\n5. Fine Focus Knob\n6. Stage\n7. Lamp\n8. Condenser\n9. Stage control\n\nMagnification\n\nMagnification is the process of enlarging the appearance of an object. We calculate the magnification of an object by indicating the fold change in size. So if something appears to be double the size of the real item, then it is obviously magnified 2X. Because there is a magnification by the eye-piece (ocular lens), as well as the objective lenses, our final magnification of an item is the product of those two lenses.\n\nThe lowest magnification objective lens (usually 4X or 5X) is referred to as a scanning lens. There is also usually a low power lens at 10X and a higher magnification lens at 40X. There may be a higher magnification lens at 100X but these usually require oil to function properly and are often reserved for microbiology labs.\n\n• What is the power of the ocular lens?\n• We can calculate that as:\nMagnificationtotal = Magnificationobjective X Magnificationocular\n• With this in mind, fill in the following table:\n\nField of View (FOV)\n\nIn a microscope, we ordinarily observe things within a circular space (or field) as defined by the lenses. We refer to this observable area as the field of view (FOV). Understanding the size of the FOV is important because actual siz",

Make sure to mention the source of your props if you borrowed them from a person or organization. You should cite the source of all data and images used in your presentation. There are conflicting opinions about whether the source citations should be on the individual slides or at the end of the presentation on a final slide. Including citations throughout the slide deck places the source information adjacent to the relevant text, but it is often so small as to be unreadable. Placing citations at the end of your presentation reduces clutter on the slides and allows the citation information to be larger and more legible. In all cases, refer to your sources when speaking and be able to provide exact citations for anyone interested in your sources. Citing your sources provides credibility to your content and shows you are a professional.\n\nOnce you have decided on which visual aids to use and have prepared them for your presentation, you should practice with them repeatedly. Through practice you will be able to seamlessly incorporate them into your presentation, which will reduce distractions, increase your credibility, and keep the audience's attention focused on your message. Practice will also help determine the time required for your presentation so you can edit before you speak if necessary. No audience benefits from the speaker looking at the time, admitting how off schedule they are, or rushing through their remaining slides.\n\nNo matter which visual aid(s) you have chosen, they should be displayed only when you are ready to talk about them. Otherwise, the audience will spend time reading any text or guessing the meaning of the visual instead of focusing on the presenter's words. Once used, visuals should also be removed from sight so as not to continue to distract the audience (Palmer, 2011).\n\nA picture is the expression of an impression. If the beautiful were not in us, how would we ever recognize it? ~ Ernst Haas\n\n13.06: Conclusion\n\nThis chapter addresses both the role and value of using visual aids, including slideware, objects, audio and video clips, and demonstrations. They should be used only when they help to clarify or enhance your spoken words or will help your audience remember your message.\n\nBe sure that any visual aid you use adds to what you are saying. Slides should be brief, easy to understand, and complement your message. Objects and slides should not be revealed before you begin talking about them, lest your audience become distracted from your point. Remember that people cannot read your slides or handouts at the same time as they are listening to you.\n\nWhen designing slides make sure they are clear and visible to the entire audience. Contrasting colors with consideration for common color blindness should be used. Screen- friendly fonts of sufficient size to be read from the back of the room are extremely important.",

                "source_content": "We tend to take water for granted. We’re never far from a spigot in our everyday lives and thirst is our usual gauge for water need. We might have felt differently if we had lived just a short distance back in history, or if we lived in one of the arid areas of the earth. When people have to haul their water in from the well or up from the river, or have to live with the constant menace of not enough water to sustain life, they don’t take it for granted.\n\nBut even when water is hard to come by, we seldom think about its importance for bodily function and health. As is so often the case, we only become aware when there’s a problem— extraordinary sensations of parched heat and/or thirst—and don’t think of dehydration when the clues aren’t obvious (as with jet lag or ‘instant weight loss diets’).\n\nIn fact, we are largely made of water, and water plays a crucial role in all of our bodily processes. We need a constant supply, and can quickly compromise our health (and a sense of physical well being) when we don’t get enough.\n\nAs well as science can determine, it was in some quiet backwater of the sea that life began on earth. Indeed, life as we know it could hardly have begun anywhere else but in water.\n\nIn this chapter, we begin by looking at the role of water in the chemistry of life and how that role extends to water’s various functions in the body, particularly its bodily role in circulation, cooling, and waste disposal. We then discuss how we vary in how much water we need, and how we meet that need through food and drink.\n\n12.02: The Chemistry of Life and the Primitive Sea\n\nThe first making of life’s chemicals seems to have required few ingredients. In that time—the Precambrian Era—it’s thought that the planet’s atmosphere was rich in such gases as methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide. These gases dissolve in water, allowing them to react with one another.\n\nThe reactions that combine these gases require intense energy. In that era, the seas would have been exposed to the energy from such sources as lightning and cosmic rays, which were much more powerful than they are today. So it’s thought that such a combination of water, primitive gases, and intense energy brought forth the first of life’s chemicals.\n\nDecades ago, scientists began to test this hypothesis of life’s origins. They reproduced what was thought to be the ancient chemical soup of life. Into water, they dissolved the simple gases methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nThese gases, along with water (H2O), hold the key atomic elements of life—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. From the simplest plant to the complex brain, living substances are composed mainly of these four elements.\n\nThe scientists then exposed this chemical soup to a steady bombardment of electrical energy. And day by day, new chemicals emerged. First, the solution began to yield such new molecules as acetic acid (vinegar) and formaldehyde. Then, as the bombardment continued, these chemicals bec",

The sample had to be fully saturated with hydrogen gas and all the oxygen eliminated. The method is not suitable for rapid automated analysis of blood samples. Current methods of pH measurement include:\n\n• Colorimetric methods. Litmus paper is used to decide between acid or base but papers incorporating pH-sensitive dyes have been been designed to measure finer gradations of pH (eg urine pH is estimated by use of indicator dyes in dipsticks). Progress in colorimetric pH methods using indicator dyes (incl. fluorescent dyes) has lead to the development of accurate intravascular methods of pH measurement. The Paratrend 7+ is a commercially available system for measuring intra-arterial pH and blood gases.\n• Glass electrodes. These are widely used in medical applications eg blood-gas machines.\n• ISFET electrodes - using 'Ion-selective field effect transistors'. These are used mostly in industry but have beendeveloped for intravascular use.\n\nThe Glass pH Electrode\n\nCremer in 1906 discovered that a electrical potential developed across a glass membrane which was proportional to the pH difference across the membrane. Kerridge in 1925 developed the first glass electrode for analysis of blood samples.MacInnes & Dole in 1929 experimented with different types of glass to find the one which was most sensitive. This MacInnes-Dole glass (known as Corning 015 glass) consists of 72% silicon dioxide, 6% calcium oxide and 22% disodium oxide (Na2O).\n\nThe pH electrode consists of 2 half cells: the glass electrode and a reference electrode (eg calomel electrode). This unit develops an electrical potential across the glass which is dependent on the difference in aH+ across the glass membrane. This effectively allows measurement of the pH of the test solution because the pH in the solution on the other side of the membrane is constant. Other potentials develop in the pH electrode (eg liquid junction potential, asymmetry potential & diffusion potentials) and these are usually not quantified in a particular electrode. The problem is overcome by standardisation and calibration. Standardisation refers to the process of requiring that these potentials are the same when measuring the sample solution and when measuring the calibrating solutions. In particular, the liquid junction potential must remain unchanged. The calibrating solutions are chemical standard buffer solutions with a known pH. Many of the components of the electrode (eg the calomel reference cell) are very temperature sensitive. The temperature of the measurement must be precisely controlled: usually at 37°C.\n\nTemperature Correction\n\nIf required, modern blood gas machines will report the pH value for actual patient temperature but this corrected value is calculated mathematically from the pH measured at 37°C in the machine. The change in pH with temperature is almost linear and 'anaero",

To simplify this, banks pushed mortgages on prospective homeowners who could not afford to repay them. Then they combined and packaged varying mortgage-backed securities based off of these loans and sold them as highly dependable and safe investments, either through a lack of due diligence (negligence) or lack of ethical consideration. This created an economic meltdown, starting with the United States, that spread across the global markets.\n\nThe inherent complexity of the causes and dramatic repercussions (most of which are still ongoing) require a great deal of context. It is a fiercely debated and widely discussed issue in the field of economics (and in mainstream media), providing a real-life case study for many of the critical concepts of economic theory.\n\nHow Did This Happen?\n\nThe inputs to the 2007-2008 economic collapse, briefly touched upon above, are complex and still evolving. That being said, there are a few key talking points from an economic perspective that should be discussed. A useful perspective to take is the various stakeholders and their contributions:\n\nInputs to the Mortgage Crisis: This graph outlines two of the three parties in the collapse (excludes government), as the banks and the buyers both took on ridiculous amounts of risk.\n\n• Banks: Simply put, the banks made two critical errors. First, they lent money to people who could not pay it back (to buy homes). They pursued what is referred to as ‘predatory lending,’ or lending to individuals they knew could never pay it back. Secondly, banks knowingly grouped these loans into bundles called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and sold them as extremely safe derivative investments. They were not safe.\n• Consumers: Consumers played their role as well, acting as easy prey for the banks predatory practices. Individuals bought homes they could not afford utilizing loans they could not pay back. This drove them into debt, to the extent at which they had to default. This meant that the capital banks expected to get back did not arrive, it simply was not there.\n• Government: The government did not regulate the housing market, as a result of the elimination of two critical legal clauses that required the verification of income and a 20% down payment. In short, the U.S. government used to ensure that prospective home buyers could put down 20% of the their borrowing in addition to verify that their income could cover their mortgage paym",

Rigdol uses a combination of acrylic paint, pastel, and pieces of manuscript pages assembled on paper to create a complex rendering of a multi-armed, multi-headed deity—over seven feet tall—who emerges between the interlocking edges of a grid-like overlay. Although the main figure is one that is recognizably sacred for Tibetan Buddhist practitioners, the work itself constitutes a radical departure from historical precedent, and reflects contemporary questions surrounding exile, activism, and cultural heritage.\n\nRigdol was born in 1982 in Kathmandu, Nepal. His parents fled Tibet in the late 1960s and worked in Nepal’s carpet industry. After training in traditional Tibetan arts, including thangka painting (a painting on fabric depicting a Buddhist subject), sand painting, and butter sculpture, the artist turned to contemporary modes of representation. He is one of the first contemporary Tibetan artists to have his work collected by major institutions, including The Metropolitan Museum of Art. By using culturally specific forms in radically new compositions, Rigdol shifts his work’s focus away from the spiritual symbolism often associated with Tibetan art, and towards more politically charged content.\n\nWho is Avalokiteshvara?\n\nIn the center of Pin drop silence is the Buddhist deity known as Avalokiteshvara (Tibetan: Chenrezig). Avalokiteshvara is a bodhisattva (an enlightened being who helps others achieve enlightenment) and is the embodiment of compassion. Avalokiteshvara remains a major figure in Buddhist art throughout Asia (he is known as Guanyin in China). The Dalai Lama is viewed as the earthly incarnation of Avalokiteshvara by practitioners, and as such, plays an important role in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nIn Pin drop silence, Avalokiteshvara is shown in his eleven-headed form, a reference to his head splitting into several parts in order to more fully observe the world and disseminate compassion. Unlike traditional imagery of Avalokiteshvara, however, none of Rigdol’s Avalokiteshvara’s heads are given a face. For orthodox Tibetan Buddhist practitioners, this omission is significant; buddhas and bodhisattvas are traditionally drawn with very specific guidelines and gridlines in place, including precise renderings of facial features. Here, Rigdol omits these features and seemingly splits the image into pieces with his use of gridlines.\n\nGuidelines and Gridlines\n\nIn traditional Tibetan Buddhist painting known as thangka, gridlines were (and are) used as guides to ensure the proper placement and depiction of buddhas (of which there are many, not just the historical Buddha Shakyamuni) and bodhisattvas. The lines are the first step of the process, and they are ultimately covered by the paint—they function merely as guidelines for the ar",

Although it is possible to design the questionnaire so that a special ‘Not applicable’ code is allocated for any such questions, an alternative is to design the questionnaire to allow the respondent to skip such questions. An example is given in Figure A14.4.\n\nFigure A14.4 Design of a sequence of questions which allow questions that are not applicable to be skipped by appropriate respondents (face-to-face interview using pen and paper).\n\n14.5 Recording of multiple items of information for direct computer entry\n\nSometimes, one needs to ask a series of questions about each person in a group (for example, household). In such situations, the questions series might be structured in a table, as shown in Figure A14.5.\n\nFigure A14.5 Design of a form to record a series of questions about children born to the same woman (face-to-face interview using pen and paper).\n\n14.6 ‘Open’ questions\n\nAlthough open questions should be avoided if possible in questionnaires, as collating and post-coding such questions can be very time consuming in large studies, occasionally it is essential to have an open question.

                "source_content": "Introduction\n\nAs described in Chapter 6, water-surface waves propagating in water much shallower than the wavelength cause a back-and-forth motion of the water at the bottom. If the maximum speed of the water (which is attained in the middle of the oscillation) exceeds the threshold for sediment movement, oscillatory-flow bed forms develop. This is common in the shallow ocean. Swell from distant storms causes bottom oscillatory motion even though the weather is fine and calm locally. More importantly, bottom-water motions under large storm waves cause bed forms also. In that situation there is likely to be a non-negligible unidirectional current as well, resulting in a combined flow.\n\nA Tank Experiment on Oscillatory-Flow Bed Configurations\n\nThere are three ways to make oscillatory-flow bed configurations in the laboratory. One is to build a big long tank and make waves in it by putting a wave generator at one end and a wave absorber at the other end (Figure $1$). The generator does not need to be anything more than a flap hinged at the bottom and rocked back and forth in the direction of the tank axis at the desired period. This arrangement makes nice bed forms, but the trouble is that you are limited to short oscillation periods.\n\nAnother good way to make oscillatory-flow bed configurations is to build a horizontal closed duct that connects smoothly with reservoir tanks at both ends, fill the whole apparatus with water, and then put a piston in contact with the water surface in one of the reservoir tanks and oscillate it up and down at the desired period (Figure $2$). This allows you to work with much longer-period oscillations, but there is the practical problem that the apparatus has its own natural oscillation period, and if you try to make oscillations at a much different period you have to fight against what the duct wants to do, and that means large forces.\n\nThe third way should seem elegant and ingenious to you: place a sand-covered horizontal tray at the bottom of a large tank of water, and oscillate the tray back and forth underneath the water (Figure $3$). The problem is that the details of particle and fluid accelerations are subtly different from the other two devices, and it turns out that the bed configurations produced in this kind of apparatus do not correspond well with those produced in the other two kinds of apparatus.\n\nImagine making an exploratory series of runs in an oscillatory-flow duct of the kind shown in Figure $2$ to obtain a general idea of the nature of oscillatory-flow bed configurations. Work at just one oscillation period, in the range from three to five seconds. Start at a low maximum oscillation velocity and increase it in steps. Figure $4$ shows the sequence of bed configurations you would observe.\n\nOnce the movement threshold is reached, a pattern of extremely regular and straight-crested ripples develops on a previously planar bed. The ripples are symmetrical in cross section, with sharp crests and broad tr",

It forms four covalent bonds, which give it great flexibility in bonding. It makes fairly strong bonds with itself (a characteristic called catenation), allowing for the formation of large molecules; it also forms fairly strong bonds with other elements, allowing for the possibility of a wide variety of substances. No other element demonstrates the versatility of carbon when it comes to making compounds. So an entire field of chemistry is devoted to the study of the compounds and reactivity of one element.\n\nBecause of the potential for complexity, chemists have defined a rather rigorous system to describe the chemistry of carbon. We will introduce some of that system in this chapter. Should you continue your study of chemistry beyond this text, you will find a much larger world of organic chemistry than we can cover in a single chapter.\n\n• 16.1: Prelude to Organic Chemistry\nPhotosynthesis involves a whole series of reactions with many chemicals, enzymes, breaking and making chemical bonds, the transfer of electrons and H+ ions, and other chemical processes. The elucidation of the actual steps of photosynthesis—a process still unduplicated artificially—is a major achievement of modern chemistry.\n• 16.2: Hydrocarbons\nThe simplest organic compounds are hydrocarbons and are composed of carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons can be aliphatic or aromatic; aliphatic hydrocarbons are divided into alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes. The combustion of hydrocarbons is a primary source of energy for our society.\n• 16.3: Branched Hydrocarbons\nA unique name can be given to branched hydrocarbons. A unique structure can be drawn for the name of a hydrocarbon.\n• 16.4: Alkyl Halides and Alcohols\nThe presence of a halogen atom (F, Cl, Br, or I; X is also used to represent any halogen atom) is one of the simplest functional groups. Organic compounds that contain a halogen atom are called alkyl halides.\n• 16.5: Other Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups\nAldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, and ethers have oxygen-containing functional groups.\n• 16.6: Other Functional Groups\nThere are some common, and important, functional groups that contain elements other than oxygen. In this section, we will consider three of them: amine, amide, and thiol functional groups.\n• 16.7: Polymers\nPolymers are long molecules composed of chains of units called monomers. Several important biological polymers include proteins, starch, cellulose, and DNA.\n• 16.E: Organic Chemistry (Exercises)\nThese are exercises and select solutions to accompany Chapter 16 of the \"Beginning Chemistry\" Textmap formulated around the Ball et al. textbook.\n\nThumbnail: DNA Double Helix (Public Domain; National Human Genome Research Institute via Wikipedia). \n\n16: Organic Chemistry \n\nAll life on Earth is ultimately based on photosynthesis.

These cases typically involve financial fraud. (Read about investor Bernie Madoff, the man responsible for the largest financial fraud in U.S. history). Financial fraud is certainly an example of unethical (and, often, illegal) behavior, but it isn’t directly related to marketing. Despite the presence of financial scandals in the news, you might be surprised to learn that the ethical issues U.S. businesses worry about the most are related to marketing.[1] Take a look at their “top eight” list of ethical concerns, below:\n\n1. Gifts, gratuities, bribes (marketing and sales)\n2. Price discrimination and unfair pricing (marketing and sales)\n3. Dishonest advertising (marketing and sales)\n4. Miscellaneous unfair competitive practices\n5. Cheating customers, unfair credit practices, and overselling (marketing and sales)\n6. Price collusion by competitors or price fixing (marketing and sales)\n7. Dishonesty in making or keeping a contract\n8. Unfairness to employees and prejudice in hiring\n\nYou will notice that five of the eight ethical issues cited are governed by the marketing function, and the other three can certainly affect or involve marketing. In this section, you’ll learn more about these issues and the challenges in overcoming them. As with ethics in general, the line between ethical behavior and unethical behavior can be very fine indeed.\n\nThe specific things you’ll learn in this section include:\n\n• Define ethics in the context of marketing\n• Identify common ethical issues and their impact on individuals and organizations\n• Identify ethical issues introduced through new marketing channels\n• Explain the role of social responsibility in marketing\n\nLearning Activities\n\nThe learning activities for this section include the following:\n\n• Reading: Defining Ethics\n• Reading: Common Ethical Issues in Marketing\n• Reading: New Challenges in Marketing Ethics\n• Reading: Corporate Social Responsibility\n• Self Check: Ethical Marketing Issues\n\n1.

The amplitude conveys the sinusoid's physical units (volts, lumens, etc). The frequency f has unitsof Hz (Hertz) or s-1, and determines how rapidly the sinusoid oscillates per unit time. The temporal variable t always has units of seconds, and thus the frequency determines how many oscillations/second the sinusoid has. AM radio stations have carrier frequencies of about 1 MHz (one mega-hertz or 106 Hz), while FM stations have carrier frequencies of about 100 MHz. Frequency can also be expressed by the symbol $\\omega \\nonumber$\n\nwhich has units of radians/second. Clearly,\n\n$\\omega =2\\pi f \\nonumber$\n\nIn communications, we most often express frequency in Hertz.\n\nFinally,\n\n$\\varphi \\nonumber$\n\nis the phase, and determines the sine wave's behavior at the origin (t=0). It has units of radians, but we can express it in degrees, realizing that in computations we must convert from degrees to radians. Note that if\n\n$\\varphi = -\\frac{\\pi }{2} \\nonumber$\n\nthe sinusoid corresponds to a sine function, having a zero value at the origin.\n\n$A\\sin (2\\pi ft+\\varphi )=A\\cos \\left ( 2\\pi ft+\\varphi -\\frac{\\pi }{2}\\right ) \\nonumber$\n\nThus, the only difference between a sine and cosine signal is the phase; we term either a sinusoid.\n\nWe can also define a discrete-time variant of the sinusoid:\n\n$A\\cos (2\\pi ft+\\varphi ) \\nonumber$\n\nHere, the independent variable is n and represents the integers. Frequency now has no dimensions, and takes on values between 0 and 1.\n\nExercise $1$\n\nShow that\n\n$cos (2\\pi fn)= \\cos (2\\pi (f+1)n) \\nonumber$\n\nwhich means that a sinusoid having a frequency larger than one corresponds to a sinusoid having a frequency less than one.\n\nSolution\n\n$As \\cos (\\alpha +\\beta )= \\cos (\\alpha) \\cos (\\beta) - \\sin (\\alpha )\\sin (\\beta )\\ cos (2\\pi (f+1)n)= cos (2\\pi fn)cos (2\\pi n) - \\sin (2\\pi fn)sin (2\\pi n) = cos (2\\pi fn) \\nonumber$\n\nNotice that we shall call either sinusoid an analog signal. Only when the discrete-time signal takes on a finite set of values can it be considered a digital signal.\n\nExercise $1$\n\nCan you think of a simple signal that has a finite number of values but is defined in continuous time? Such a signal is also an analog signal.\n\nSolution\n\nA square wave takes on the values 1 and -1 alternately.

Cultural anthropologists always take a holistic approach which means that we look at many elements that tie together to create a lived experience. We are not focused on making moral judgments, nor are we interested in proving anyone’s belief systems to be true, false, better, or worse. Rather, we strive to understand a group of people in their own, culturally specific logic. You are expected to achieve all of these goals whenever you conduct your own fieldwork.\n\nIf required to complete ethnographic fieldwork for your anthropology class, you’ll likely encounter some of the most common challenges faced by anthropologists:\n\n1. You will need to understand the other culture’s specific logic. This means that, when something doesn’t make sense to you, you need to ask yourself, “what would need to be true for this to be the case?“ You will need to speak to the people in the community and try to get to the bottom of the beliefs and practices that are the most foreign to you.\n2. You will need to avoid removing the power from the people that you’re interviewing. While you are expected to compose the paper, yourself, you should still rely heavily on the information given to you by members of the community. Feel free to include long quotes and stories directly from the community. You are expected to comment on information coming from your informants; you are expected to analyze the cultural practices anthropologically. But, you should try your best to amplify the voices of the people that you are studying at the same time.\n3. You will need to overcome the instinctual desire to measure others’ cultures against your own. If you approach the culture with the idea that it should be measured against your own belief systems, then you will not succeed in your fieldwork. You need to understand the community on its own terms and be prepared to understand the community based on its own standards.\n\n2.2 Participant Observation: A Practical Guide for Students\n\nRemember that there are four steps of participant observation. As students of anthropology (likely completing a miniature ethnography), you’ll need to demonstrate your ability to engage with these concepts within the limitations of your anthropology course.\n\n1. Stay for a long time: Without the ability to travel and live abroad for years as part of your anthropology class, you should still achieve a truncated version of this important step. When you plan to visit your community-of-study, plan to stay as long as possible. Don’t simply swing by their information booth for 15 minutes and then go home. Rathe",

                "source_content": "Memory requires a certain degree of brain maturation, so it should not be surprising that infant memory is rather fleeting and fragile. As a result, older children and adults experience infantile amnesia, the inability to recall memories from the first few years of life. Several hypotheses have been proposed for this amnesia. From the biological perspective, it has been suggested that infantile amnesia is due to the immaturity of the infant brain, especially those areas that are crucial to the formation of autobiographical memory, such as the hippocampus. From the cognitive perspective, it has been suggested that the lack of linguistic skills of babies and toddlers limit their ability to mentally represent events; thereby, reducing their ability to encode memory. Moreover, even if infants do form such early memories, older children and adults may not be able to access them because they may be employing very different, more linguistically based, retrieval cues than infants used when forming the memory. Finally, social theorists argue that episodic memories of personal experiences may hinge on an understanding of “self”, something that is clearly lacking in infants and young toddlers.\n\nHowever, in a series of clever studies Carolyn Rovee-Collier and her colleagues have demonstrated that infants can remember events from their life, even if these memories are short- lived. Three-month-old infants were taught that they could make a mobile hung over their crib shake by kicking their legs. The infants were placed in their crib, on their backs. A ribbon was tied to one foot and the other end to a mobile. At first infants made random movements, but then came to realize that by kicking they could make the mobile shake. After two 9 minute sessions with the mobile, the mobile was removed. One week later the mobile was reintroduced to one group of infants and most of the babies immediately started kicking their legs, indicating that they remembered their prior experience with the mobile. A second group of infants was shown the mobile two weeks later and the babies made only random movements. The memory had faded (Rovee-Collier, 1987; Giles & Rovee-Collier, 2011). Rovee-Collier and Hayne (1987) found that 3-month-olds could remember the mobile after two weeks if they were shown the mobile and watched it move, even though they were not tied to it. This reminder helped most infants to remember the connection between their kicking and the movement of the mobile. Like many researchers of infant memory, Rovee-Collier (1990) found infant memory to be very context dependent. In other words, the sessions with the mobile and the later retrieval sessions had to be conducted under very similar circumstances or else the babies would not remember their prior experiences with the mobile. For instance, if the first mobile had had yellow blocks with blue letters, but at the later retrieval session the blocks were blue with yellow letters, the babies would not kick.\n\nInfants o",

Figure 11.5 shows graphically how the vectors $are defined. These vectors \\(\\mathbf{r}_{1}^{\\prime}=\\mathbf{r}_{1}-\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}} \\text { and } \\mathbf{r}_{2}^{\\prime}=\\mathbf{r}_{2}-\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathrm{cm}}$ represent the positions of the two particles relative to the center of mass.

This leads to the conclusion that $\\mathrm{M}_{1} \\mathrm{~d}_{1}=\\mathrm{M}_{2} \\mathrm{~d}_{2}$ in figure 11.5.

                "source_content": "The Haber-Bosch Process for Synthesis of Ammonia\n\nAn example of an industrial catalytic process is the Haber-Bosch process. Karl Bosch (1874–1940) was a German chemical engineer who was responsible for designing the process that took advantage of Fritz Haber’s discoveries regarding the N2 + H2/NH3 equilibrium to make ammonia synthesis via this route cost-effective. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1931 for his work. The industrial process is called either the Haber process or the Haber-Bosch process. used to synthesize ammonia via the following reaction:\n\n$N_{2(g)}+3H_{2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3(g)} \\nonumber$\n\nwith\n\n$ΔH_{rxn}=−91.8\\; kJ/mol \\nonumber$\n\nBecause the reaction converts 4 mol of gaseous reactants to only 2 mol of gaseous product, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that the formation of NH3 will be favored when the pressure is increased. The reaction is exothermic, however (ΔHrxn = −91.8 kJ/mol), so the equilibrium constant decreases with increasing temperature, which causes an equilibrium mixture to contain only relatively small amounts of ammonia at high temperatures ($1$). Taken together, these considerations suggest that the maximum yield of NH3 will be obtained if the reaction is carried out at as low a temperature and as high a pressure as possible. Unfortunately, at temperatures less than approximately 300°C, where the equilibrium yield of ammonia would be relatively high, the reaction is too slow to be of any commercial use. The industrial process, therefore, uses a mixed oxide (Fe2O3/K2O) catalyst that enables the reaction to proceed at a significant rate at temperatures of 400°C–530°C, where the formation of ammonia is less unfavorable than at higher temperatures.\n\nBecause of the low value of the equilibrium constant at high temperatures (e.g., K = 0.039 at 800 K), there is no way to produce an equilibrium mixture that contains large proportions of ammonia at high temperatures. We can, however, control the temperature and the pressure while using a catalyst to convert a fraction of the N2 and H2 in the reaction mixture to NH3, as is done in the Haber-Bosch process. This process also makes use of the fact that the product—ammonia—is less volatile than the reactants. Because NH3 is a liquid at room temperature at pressures greater than 10 atm, cooling the reaction mixture causes NH3 to condense from the vapor as liquid ammonia, which is easily separated from unreacted N2 and H2. The unreacted gases are recycled until the complete conversion of hydrogen and nitrogen to ammonia is eventually achieved. Figure $2$ is a simplified layout of a Haber-Bosch process plant.\n\nWe can write the seven reactions that are involved in the process where ad indicates that the molecule or atom is adsorbed on the catalyst\n\n$H_{2}(g) + 2 S(s) \\rightleftharpoons 2H \\mathit{(ad)} \\label{1}$\n\n$N_{2}(g) \\rightleftharpoons N_2 \\mathit{(ad)} \\label{2}$\n\n$N_2 \\mathit{(ad)} + 2 S(s) \\rightleftharpoons 2N \\mathit{(ad)} \\label{3}$\n\n$H \\mathit{",

A tariff is a tax that is imposed by a government on imported or exported goods. They are also known as customs duties.\n\nTypes of Tariffs\n\nTariffs can be classified based on what is being taxed:\n\n• Import tariffs: Taxes on goods that are imported into a country. They are more common than export tariffs.\n• Export tariffs: Taxes on goods that are leaving a country. This may be done to raise tariff revenue or to restrict world supply of a good.\n\nTariffs may also be classified by their purpose:\n\n• Protective tariffs: Tariffs levied in order to reduce foreign imports of a product and to protect domestic industries.\n• Revenue tariffs: Tariffs levied in order to raise revenue for the government.\n\nTariffs can also be classified on how the duty amount is valued:\n\n• Specific tariffs: Tariffs that levy a flat rate on each item that is imported. For example, a specific tariff would be a fixed \\$1,000 duty on every car that is imported into a country, regardless of how much the car costs.\n• Ad valorem tariffs: Tariffs based on a percentage of the value of each item. For example, an ad valorem tariff would be a 20% tax on the value of every car imported into a country.\n• Compound tariffs: Tariffs that are a combination of specific tariffs and ad valorem tariffs. For example, a compound tariff might consist of a fixed \\$100 duty plus 10% of the value of every imported car.\n\nConsequences of Levying a Tariff\n\nTo see the effects of levying an import tariff, consider the example shown in. Assume that there is an import tax levied on a good in a domestic country, Home. The domestic supply of the good is represented by the diagonal supply curve, and world supply is perfectly elastic and represented by the horizontal line at \\(P_w\\). Before a tariff is levied, the domestic price is at \\(P_w\\), and the quantity demanded is at \\(D\\) (with quantity \\(S\\) provided domestically, and quantity \\(D−S\\) imported).\n\nEffects of a Tariff: When a tariff is levied on imported goods, the domestic price of the good rises. This benefits domestic producers by increasing producer surplus, but domestic consumers see a small consumer surplus.\n\nWhen the tariff is imposed, the domestic price of the good rises to \\(P_t\\). Now, more of the good is provided domestically; instead of producing \\(S\\), it now produces \\(S^*\\). Imports of the good fall, from the quantity \\(D−S\\) to the new quantity \\(D^*−S^*\\). With the higher prices, domestic producers experience a gain in producer surplus (shown as area A). In contrast, because of the higher prices, domestic consumers experience a loss in consumer surplus; consumer surplus shrinks from the area above \\(P_w\\) to the area above \\(P_t\\) (it shrinks by the areas A, B, C, and D).\n\nBeca",

                "source_content": "Why Language Learning Seems Hard\n\nExercise \\(1\\)\n\nSay a child is presented with a single example of an apple along with the word apple. What would it take for the child to be able to correctly apply the word in the future to other apples and not incorrectly apply it to, say, pears or strawberries or mushrooms?\n\nOne of the striking, and very powerful, features of human language is that it is learned. Within the domain of words alone, the fact that language is learned allows people to continually come up with new words for new concepts (by extension or combination of existing words, by borrowing, or by inventing). When words are combined to form sentences, even greater flexibility is possible, as we'll say later on in the book.\n\nIn and of itself, learning is not so impressive; after all, some birds learn their songs. Language learning seems amazing for two reasons.\n\n1. What is learned, a human language, is very complex.\n2. The information that children are provided about the language seems insufficient.\n\nWe'll be examining the complexity of language throughout this book. For now, I'll mention just one aspect of language you should already be familiar with. Language is applicable to a potentially infinite range of situations. That is, the learner has to generalize, to go beyond the examples that are seen during learning and apply language to novel situations. Once you know a word like rock, for example, you have the ability to use it to refer to any rock you might encounter and to understand it when someone else does this. Conversely, you know when not to use the word rock; you would not apply it to some sand, for example. And when you hear someone else using the word and there are several possible referents around, you know that the speaker is not referring to a tree or a puddle. The problem is that when you're learning the meaning of the word, you can't possibly be shown all rocks and told that they belong to the semantic category rock and shown everything else and told that it doesn't belong to the category.\n\nLearning What Is and What Isn't a Rock\n\nTo see why this would matter, let's consider a very simple \"language\", consisting of just one word, rock. As a language learner, you have to figure out the meaning of each word. (You also have to figure out how to pronounce each word, but I'll save that kind of complexity for the next chapter.) Let's simplify further by assuming that the information you receive about the language consists of presentations of pairs of objects and words with no distractions of any kind (other objects that could be possible referents for the word, other words that could refer to the object). After lots of these presentations, you should begin to have an idea of what a rock is; that is, you would know how to use the word rock when you see an object that is very similar to the rocks you've been presented. But what about a potential referent that is notso similar, for example, a rock that is much larger than the ones you've ",

                "source_content": "Introduction\n\nMany crimes are defined with reference to some prohibited (or highly regulated) object or substance. The two most familiar examples, and the focus of this chapter, are drug offenses and gun offenses. The simplest form of a prohibited-object offense is possession—possession of cocaine, for example—but the concept of possession is sometimes complicated, as explored in this chapter. Another common form of prohibited-object offenses combines possession with the intent to distribute. Other statutes criminalize the actual distribution, or the manufacture, transportation, or storage of prohibited substances or objects. Criminal regulations of drugs and guns generate an enormous number of cases on criminal court dockets. Indeed, more Americans are arrested for drug crimes than for any other general category of crimes, such as violent offenses or property crimes. Gun crimes do not generate nearly as large a share of the criminal court docket as drug offenses do, but they are a significant source of both criminal convictions and eventual prison sentences. And gun enhancements—an increase in the penalty for some other criminal conduct based on the defendant’s possession of a gun—are an important contributing factor to the size of America’s prisoner population.\n\nThe rationale for the criminalization of guns or drugs may seem self-evident: possession of the object is thought to be dangerous, and therefore the government wishes to deter possession. But note that this category of criminal law imposes punishment for the creation of a risk, rather than for the actual materialization of some harm. No one needs to experience adverse effects of drug use, or even to use drugs at all, for prosecutors to establish an offense of drug possession or distribution. Similarly, the weapons offenses addressed in this chapter typically involve guns that don’t go off, but are seen as sufficiently risky that mere possession is criminalized. If a gun does go off – if it is used to shoot someone – criminal law typically addresses that actual harm through assault or homicide law. Thus, this chapter gives us the opportunity to think about the decision to criminalize risky conduct without requiring proof of an actual injury. How should policymakers determine that a given object or substance is dangerous enough to criminalize? What kinds of factors – such as empirical evidence, moral judgments, or political considerations – actually do influence these criminalization decisions?\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the crimes addressed in this chapter is that they typically involve consensual conduct. That is, the person who possesses drugs or a gun has often obtained the contraband by choice, from a willing seller; the person who distributes the prohibited object is usually doing so to a willing purchaser. The crimes addressed in this chapter are often called “victimless” crimes, in the sense that there is usually not a specific person who is directly injured by the prohibited",

                "source_content": "A. Extrapolating Results From Model Radicals\n\nRadical philicity first was encountered in this chapter in the reactions of simple organic com­pounds (Section I.B). The assumption was that infor­mation about the reac­tivity of these com­pounds could be extrapolated to more complex ones, ­specifically, carbo­hy­drates. Exper­imental data supported the validity of this assumption by providing examples of reactions of carbo­hy­drate radi­cals that qualitatively paralleled those of simpler radicals. For instance, the reactions in eq 2 showed the cyclo­hexyl radical (a carbohy­drate model) to be nucleo­philic because it added more rapidly to electron-deficient multiple bonds than to electron-rich ones.6 A similar, nucleophilic behavior was seen in the reac­tions of the carbohydrate radical 26 (Scheme 2). In another example, the reac­tions described in equations 4 and 5 for simple organic mole­cules showed ­that polarity matching increased the rate of hydrogen-atom abstraction. Extending polarity matching to carbo­hydrate radicals offered a rationale for the electro­philic radical 22 abstracting an electron-rich hydrogen atom more rapidly than an electron-deficient one (Scheme 1). There is, of course, a limitation to extra­polation of results obtained from simple radicals to radicals that are more complicated. Iden­tifying a limitation, as is done in the following section, can be useful and can lead to increased under­standing of the reactivity of the more complicated radical.\n\nB. A Limitation on Extrapolating Alkyl Radical Reactivity to Carbohydrate Radicals\n\nExtrapolating results from reactions of structurally simple intermediates sometimes provides the only information available for judging reactivity of more complex ones. Successful extrap­o­la­tion builds confidence in the models selected, but since model systems by their very nature have limitations, such extrapolation is always subject to some uncertainty. The reaction shown in eq 9 illus­trates the need for caution in projecting reactivity from a simple to a more complex radical. The data in Table 2 show that rate constants for hydrogen-atom abstraction from com­pounds with H–Sn, H–S, and H–Si bonds are essentially inde­pendent of whether the abstracting radical is primary, sec­on­dary, or tertiary. (Steric factors have little effect on rate constants for hydrogen abstract­tion.41) Extending this reactivity pattern to compounds with H–Se bonds and knowing that the rate constant for hydrogen-atom abstraction from C6H5SeH by the primary radical 27 is 2.1 x 109 M-1s-1 at 25 oC14 leads to the prediction that the rate constant for reaction of the pyranos-1-yl radical 9 with C6H5SeH should have a similar value. It does not; the value is far smaller (3.6 x 106 M‑1s-1 at 78 oC).15\n\nC.

How long will it take Lin and Diego to finish their milkshakes?\n2. Without graphing, explain what the graphs in this situation would look like. Think about slope, intercepts, axis labels, units, and intersection points to guide your thinking.\n3. Discuss your description with your partner. If you disagree, work to reach an agreement.\n\nExercise $2$: Passing on the Trail\n\nThere is a hiking trail near the town where Han and Jada live that starts at a parking lot and ends at a lake. Han and Jada both decide to hike from the parking lot to the lake and back, but they start their hikes at different times.\n\nAt the time that Han reaches the lake and starts to turn back, Jada is 0.6 miles away from the parking lot and hiking at a constant speed of 3.2 miles per hour toward the lake. Han’s distance, $d$, from the parking lot can be expressed as $d=-2.4t+4.8$, where $t$ represents the time in hours since he left the lake.\n\n1. What is an equation for Jada’s distance from the parking lot as she heads toward the lake?\n2. Draw both graphs: one representing Han’s equation and one representing Jada’s equation.

The ideas behind this topic are very similar to calculating arc length for a curve in with x and y components, but now, we are considering a third component, z.\n• 2.3: Curvature and Normal Vectors of a Curve\nFor a parametrically defined curve we had the definition of arc length. Since vector valued functions are parametrically defined curves in disguise, we have the same definition. We have the added benefit of notation with vector valued functions in that the square root of the sum of the squares of the derivatives is just the magnitude of the velocity vector.\n• 2.4: The Unit Tangent and the Unit Normal Vectors\nThe derivative of a vector valued function gives a new vector valued function that is tangent to the defined curve. The analog to the slope of the tangent line is the direction of the tangent line. Since a vector contains a magnitude and a direction, the velocity vector contains more information than we need. We can strip a vector of its magnitude by dividing by its magnitude.\n• 2.5: Velocity and Acceleration\nIn single variable calculus the velocity is defined as the derivative of the position function. For vector calculus, we make the same definition.\n• 2.6: Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration\nThis section breaks down acceleration into two components called the tangential and normal components. Similar to how we break down all vectors into $\\hat{\\textbf{i}}$, $\\hat{\\textbf{j}}$, and $\\hat{\\textbf{k}}$ components, we can do the same with acceleration. The addition of these two components will give us the overall acceleration.\n• 2.7: Parametric Surfaces\nWe have now seen many kinds of functions. When we talked about parametric curves, we defined them as functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (plane curves) or $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (space curves). Because each of these has its domain $\\mathbb{R}$, they are one dimensional (you can only go forward or backward).

The challenge lies not so much with the collection or storage of the data: today, it is possible to collect and even store vast amounts of information relatively cheaply. The main difficulty is figuring out the best and most efficient way to extract and manage the relevant data and resulting information. In this section you will learn how organizations use a variety of networks to manage their information.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n• Discuss how businesses can use intranets and extranets to manage information\n• Discuss how businesses can use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to manage information\n\nThe Internet and Cloud Computing\n\nOnce it’s grown beyond just a handful of employees, an organization needs a way of sharing information. Imagine a flower shop with twenty employees. The person who takes phone orders needs access to the store’s customer list, as do the delivery person and the bookkeeper. Now, the store may have one computer and everyone could share it. It’s more likely, however, that there are a number of computers (several for salespeople, one for delivery, and one for bookkeeping). In this case, everyone needs to be sure that customer records have been updated on all computers every time that a change is required. Traditionally the business would install a network (LAN) to allow the various computers to talk to one another and share information. Today businesses are looking to the cloud to provide a network solution.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nSo, what is cloud computing? Watch the following video, which describes some of the uses and benefits of cloud computing.\n\nThe term “cloud computing” means performing computer tasks using services provided over the Internet. In cloud computing a company’s data and applications are stored at an offsite data center that is then accessed via the Internet (the cloud). So when you hear or read that an individual or company is using the “cloud” or technology firms, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Salesforce.com, are offering cloud services, just substitute the word “Internet” for “cloud” and things will make sense.\n\nYou might be surprised to learn that you’re already using the cloud—that is if you use Facebook (which is very likely—in fact, just mentioning Facebook here might prompt you to stop studying and check out your friends’ pages).

At this equilibrium, tan molecules outnumber brown ones.\n\nc) Viridian molecules seem to be converting into gold ones but the system reaches equilibrium, at which point there are still more viridian molecules than gold ones.\n\nExercise 1.3.3:\n\na) e 2 < e 10\n\nb) e 1/4 < e 1/2\n\nc) e -3 > e -4\n\nd) e -1/2 < e -1/3\n\nExercise 1.3.4:\n\na) Orientation (i) looks most likely to result in connection of the oxygen to carbon with displacement of bromide. In orientation (iii), the oxygen appears ready to collide with the bromine atom. and in oreientation (ii), it may collide with a hydrogen atom.\n\nIn addition, you will see later that bringing the the oxygen in along the C-Br axis (but away from the bromine) is also more likely to break the C-Br bond, for reasons involving molecular orbital overlap.\n\nb) Orientation (ii) looks like the carbon anion in the acetylide ion is most likely to bond with the carbonyl carbon. In option (i), the carbon is going to collide with the carbonyl oxygen. In option (iii), it may collide with the alpha carbon, next to the carbonyl. Having the nucleophile approach from outside the plane of the carbonyl, as in option (ii), lowers the chance of collision with atoms other than the carbonyl carbon.\n\nAgain, there are also molecular orbital reasons that make this approach the preferred one.\n\nExercise 1.3.5:\n\na) We would expect the lowest barrier for breaking the Cr-CO bond. The barrier to break the Mo-CO bond would be just slightly lower than to break the W-CO bond.\n\nb) Based on this information alone, we might expect the Cr-CO cleavage to occur most rapidly. Mo-CO cleavage would be slightly faster than W-CO cleavage.\n\nExercise 1.3.6:\n\n1. On this basis alone, we would expect the lowest barrier for C=C cleavage, followed by C=N and then C=O with the highest barrier.\n2. This trend is exactly the opposite of what we just predicted based on bond strengths.\n3. There may be a few different reasons for these differences. For example, the electrophilicity of the carbon may be a factor. Based on electronegativity differences, the C=O carbon should be most positive, the C=N carbon less so and the C=C carbon not at all. That electrophilicity may raise the reactant a little in energy.\n\nAlternatively, there may be charge stabilization factors in the first-for",

                "source_content": "Córdoba, 1791 — Madrid, 1865\n\nAngel de Saavedra, Duque de Rivas, era militar, político, escritor y pintor. Vivió grandes cambios sociales y políticos en España y Europa. Fue herido en 1809 en la Guerra de la Independencia contra Napoleón. En 1823 fue condenado a muerte por su participación en el golpe de estado del militar democrático General Rafael del Riego, el pronunciamiento que inició el Trienio Liberal (1820-1823). En sus once años de exilio pasó por Gibraltar, Inglaterra, Italia, Malta y Francia. En Londres y París conoció los movimientos románticos inglés y francés y a su regreso a España, tras la muerte del rey absolutista Fernando VII en 1833, se convirtió en uno de los mayores difundidores en España del Romanticismo. A su regreso hereda el título de III Duque de Rivas. Ocupa importantes cargos en el gobierno español y con el tiempo modera sus opiniones políticas en busca de un consenso entre liberales y conservadores. Su drama más notorio es Don Álvaro o la fuerza del sino (1835), una de las obras románticas más influyentes en España y también inspiración para la ópera La forza del destino (1862) del compositor italiano Giuseppe Verdi. En esta tragedia, don Álvaro está cercado o por un destino fatal o por instituciones sociales inhóspitas al devenir individual y se suicida después de una serie de desgracias en que mueren violentamente todas las personas importantes en su vida.\n\nSaavedra contribuyó con dos artículos o cuadros de costumbres (El hospedador de provincia y El ventero) a la colección Los españoles pintados por sí mismos (1843-1844), una antología en dos volúmenes publicada en Madrid por el editor Ignacio Boix. Esta antología sigue la línea costumbrista de Les français peints par eux-mêmes (1840-1842), una reseña de los tipos franceses capitalinos, provinciales y coloniales en nueve tomos. La obra de Boix dio lugar a una amplia imitación en el mundo hispano por autores y autoras destacados de la época: El álbum del bello sexo o las mujeres pintadas por sí mismas (1843); Los cubanos pintados por sí mismos (1852); Los mexicanos pintados por sí mismos (1854); Los valencianos pintados por sí mismos (1859); Las españolas pintadas por los españoles (1871-1872); Las mujeres españolas, portuguesas y americanas, (1872, 1873, 1876); Los españoles de hogaño (1872); Las mujeres españolas, americanas y lusitanas pintadas por sí mismas (1881); y El álbum de Galicia: Tipos, costumbres y leyendas (1897). Muchos de estos textos son de interés hoy para la historia de la sociología. Los españoles pintados por sí mismos presenta sátiras de personajes típicos de la sociedad española tales como la celestina, la maja, la monja, la marisabidilla, la viuda del militar, el empleado, el escribano, el estudiante, el patriota, el poeta, el bandolero, el boticario, el indiano, el español fuera de España, etc. Aunque con estos cuadros los escritores más importantes del momento critican la sociedad española, la colección refleja el creciente interés por per",

The basics of corporate bonds and other debt leveraging\n3. What the various types of stocks are\n4. Initial public offerings and consideration for stock\n5. What dividends are\n6. Some of the modern trends in corporate finance\n\nA corporation requires money for many reasons. In this chapter, we look at the methods available to a corporation for raising funds, focusing on how firms generate large amounts of funds and finance large projects, such as building a new factory.\n\nOne major method of finance is the sale of stock. A corporation sells shares of stock, often in an initial public offering. In exchange for consideration—usually cash—the purchaser acquires stock in the corporation. This stock may give the owner a share in earnings, the right to transfer the stock, and, depending on the size of the corporation and the number of shares, power to exercise control. Other methods of corporate finance include bank financing and bonds. We also discuss some more modern financing methods, such as private equity and venture capital. Additional methods of corporate finance, such as commercial paper (see Chapter 19 \"Nature and Form of Commercial Paper\" and Chapter 20 \"Negotiation of Commercial Paper\"), are discussed elsewhere in this book. \n\n15: Legal Aspects of Corporate Finance \n\nLearning Objectives\n1. Discuss the main sources for raising corporate funds.\n2. Examine the reinvestment of earnings to finance growth.\n3. Review debt and equity as methods of raising funds.\n4. Consider private equity and venture capital, and compare their utility to other forms of financing.\n\nSources\n\nTo finance growth, any ongoing business must have a source of funds. Apart from bank and trade debt, the principal sources are plowback, debt securities, equity securities, and private equity.\n\nPlowback\n\nA significant source of new funds that corporations spend on capital projects is earnings. Rather than paying out earnings to shareholders, the corporation plows those earnings back into the business. Plowback is simply reinvesting earnings in the corporation. It is an attractive source of capital because it is subject to managerial control. No approval by governmental agencies is necessary for its expenditure, as it is when a company seeks to sell securities, or stocks and bonds. Furthermore, stocks and bonds have costs associated with them, such as the interest payments on bonds (discussed in Section 15.1.3 \"Debt Securities\"), while retaining profits avoids these costs.\n\nDebt Securities\n\nA second source of funds is borrowing through debt securities.

The active medium is a collection of atoms, or molecules that can undergo stimulated emission. The active medium can be in a gaseous, liquid or solid form.\n• For lasing to take place, the active medium must be pumped into an excited state capable of undergoing stimulated emission. The energy required for excitation is often supplied by an electric current or an intense light source, such as a flashlamp.\n• To induce stimulated emission, the laser cavity must provide a means to reflect, or feedback emitted light into the gain medium.\n• A laser must have an output coupler to allow a portion of the laser light to leave the optical cavity.\n\nLaser Optical Cavity\n\nSketch showing the main components of a laser optical (or resonator) cavity. The optical cavity is formed by a pair of mirrors that surround the gain medium and enable feedback of light into the medium. The output coupler is a partially reflective mirror that allows a portion of the laser radiation to leave the cavity. The gain medium is excited by an external source (not shown), such as a flash lamp, electric current or another laser. The light trapped between the mirrors forms standing wave structures called modes. Although beyond the scope of this discussion, the reader interested in cavity modes can consult References 7-10 and the “Laser Radiation Properties” section.\n\nStimulated Emission 7-10, 12, 13\n\n• Stimulated emission occurs when a photon of light induces an atom or molecule to lose energy by producing a second photon. The second photon has the same phase, frequency, direction of travel and polarization state as the stimulating photon.\n• Since from one photon a second identical photon is produced, stimulated emission leads to light amplification.\n• Stimulated emission can be understood from an energy level diagram within the context of the competing optical processes of stimulated absorption and spontaneous emission.\n• For stimulated emission to take place, a population inversion must be created in the laser gain medium.\n• For more on stimulated emission, see energy level diagrams and subsequent sections.\n\nEnergy Level Diagrams\n\n• An energy level diagram displays states of an atom, molecule or material as levels ordered vertically according to energy.\n• The states contain contributions from several sources, as appropriate for the matter considered. Sources include the orbital and spin angular momentum of electrons, vibrations of nuclei, molecular rotations, and spin contributions from nuclei.\n• The lowest energy level is called the ground state.\n• Absorption and emission of energy occurs when matter undergoes transitions between states.\n\nEnergy level diagram showing states of a sodium atom.

                "source_content": "There are two general representations of a dynamic model that we shall be interested in, namely behavioral and input-output description.\n\n6.2.1 Behavioral Models\n\nThis a very general representation, which we have actually taken as the basis for our initial definition of a dynamic model. In this representation, the system is described as a collection of constraints on designated signals, $w_{i}$. Any combination $w(t)=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll} w_{1}(t), & \\cdots & w_{\\ell}(t) \\end{array}\\right]$ of signals that satisfies the constraints is a behavior of the model, $w(t) \\in \\mathbb{B}$, where $\\mathbb{B}$ denotes the behavior. An example of such a representation is Example 6.1.\n\nLinearity\n\nWe call a model linear if its behavior constitutes a vector space, i.e. if superposition applies:\n\n$w_{a}(t), w_{b}(t) \\in \\mathbb{B} \\Longrightarrow \\alpha w_{a}(t)+\\beta w_{b}(t) \\in \\mathbb{B}\\ \\tag{6.15}$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are arbitrary scalars. Example 6.1 is evidently linear.\n\nTime- Invariance\n\nWe call a model time-invariant (or translation-invariant, or shift-invariant) if every possible time shift of a behavior - in which each of the signals is shifted by the same amount - yields a behavior:\n\n$w(t) \\in \\mathbb{B} \\Longrightarrow \\sigma_{\\tau} w(t)=w(t-\\tau) \\in \\mathbb{B}\\ \\tag{6.16}$\n\nfor all valid $\\tau$, i.e. $\\tau$ for which $\\mathbb{T}-\\tau \\subset \\mathbb{T}$, with $\\sigma_{r}$ denoting the $\\tau$ -shift operator. Example 6.1 is evidently time-invariant.\n\nMemoryless Models\n\nA model is memoryless if the constraints that describe the associated signals $w( \\cdot )$ are purely algebraic, i.e., they only involve constraints on $w(t_{0})$ for each $t_{0} \\in \\mathbb{T}$ (and so do not involve derivatives, integrals, etc.). More interesting to us are non-memoryless, or dynamic systems, where the constraints involve signal values at different times.\n\n6.2.2 Input-Output Models\n\nFor this class of models, the system is modeled as a mapping from a set of input signals $u(t)$ to a set of output signals, $y(t)$. We may represent this map as\n\n$y(t)=(S u)(t)\\ \\tag{6.17}$\n\n(i.e., the result of operating on the entire signal $u( \\cdot )$ with the mapping $S$ yields the signal $y( \\cdot )$, and the particular value of the output at some time $t$ is then denoted as above). The above mapping clearly also constitutes a constraint relating $u(t)$ and $y(t)$; this fact could be emphasized by trivially rewriting the equation in the form\n\n$y(t)-(S u)(t)=0 \\ \\tag{6.18}$\n\nThe definitions of linearity, time-invariance and memorylessness from the behavioral case therefore specialize easily to mappings. An example of a system representation in the form of a mapping is Example 6.5.\n\nLinearity and Time-Invariance\n\nFrom the behavioral point of view, the signals of interest are given by $w(t) = [u(t) y(t)]$. It then follows from the preceding discussion of behavioral models that the model is linear if and only if\n\n$\\left(S\\left(\\alpha u_{a}+\\beta u_{b}\\right)\\right)(t)=\\al",

Today, crowdfunding is an essential part of every entrepreneurship conversation.\n\nModern crowdfunding has the following haiku-like definition:[1]\n\n• An individual or organization,\n• on behalf of a cause, a project, a product, or a company,\n• solicits and collects money,\n• usually in relatively small amounts,\n• from a large number of people,\n• using an online platform,\n• where communications and transactions are managed over electronic networks.\n\nCrowdfunding is one of the great movements of the twenty-first century, and one of the most powerful. Still in its infancy, crowdfunding moved beyond Kickstarter-like passion projects and became a major new and disruptive force in investment funding. And just in the last few years, the crowdfunding movement impelled the U.S. Congress, state legislatures in all 50 states and the Security Exchange Commission to overhaul investment laws that existed since 1934.\n\nBroadly defined, crowdfunding is collecting small amounts of money from a large number of people. With the advent of social networks (abundance of people on the network), crowdfunding only recently became practical. But the concept has been around for centuries—except that with crowdfunding, the people willingly contribute money for a project, product, or cause that they believe in.\n\nCrowfunding—a Little History\n\nThe concept of crowdfunding is old. What’s new is applying technology—social networks—to the process. This allows interested supporters from around the globe to support any project, anywhere, as long as they share passion and see merit in the project’s goals.\n\nIn the early 1880s, France gave the United States a gift: the Statue of Liberty. It was shipped to New York City where remained packed in crates for over a year. Why? The New York state government would not allocate the \\$200,000 required to build and mount the statue onto a pedestal (today this would be over \\$2.5 million). Newspaper mogul Joseph Pulitzer ran a fundraising campaign through his “New York World” tabloid—offering to publish the name of everyone who donated, to the front page. Donors also would get little rewards: \\$1 got you a 6-inch replica statue and \\$5 got you a 12-inch statue. The campaign went viral. Within six months of the fundraising appeal, the pedestal was fully funded, with the majority of donations being under a dollar.\n\nBut this was not the first crowdfunding campaign. For centuries, book authors have appealed to the crowd for funding. Kickstarter (the largest crowdfunding site) proudly recounts one of the earliest examples:[2]\n\nIn 1713, Alexander Pope (the poet) set out to translate 15,693 lines of ancient Greek poetry into English. It took five long years to get the six volumes right, but the result was worth the wait: a translation of Homer’",

Every atom has a different velocity vector, b. Since all the velocities are different, we can't measure the speed of rotation of the top by giving a single velocity. We can, however, specify its speed of rotation consistently in terms of angle per unit time. Let the position of some reference point on the top be denoted by its angle $\\theta$, measured in a circle around the axis. For reasons that will become more apparent shortly, we measure all our angles in radians. Then the change in the angular position of any point on the top can be written as $d\\theta$, and all parts of the top have the same value of $d\\theta$ over a certain time interval $dt$. We define the angular velocity, $\\omega$ (Greek omega),\n\n$\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$\n$\\text{[definition of angular velocity; \\theta in units of radians]}$\n\nwhich is similar to, but not the same as, the quantity $\\omega$ we defined earlier to describe vibrations. The relationship between $\\omega$ and $t$ is exactly analogous to that between $x$ and $t$ for the motion of a particle through space.\n\nFigure 4.2.1: (left) he two atoms cover the same angle in a given time interval. (right) Their velocity vectors, however, differ in both magnitude and direction.\n\nExercise $1$\n\nIf two different people chose two different reference points on the top in order to define $\\theta\\text{=0}$, how would their $\\theta$-$t$ graphs differ? What effect would this have on the angular velocities?\n\n(answer in the back of the PDF version of the book)\n\nThe angular velocity has units of radians per second, rad/s. However, radians are not really units at all. The radian measure of an angle is defined, as the length of the circular arc it makes, divided by the radius of the circle. Dividing one length by another gives a unitless quantity, so anything with units of radians is really unitless. We can therefore simplify the units of angular velocity, and call them inverse seconds, $\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nExample $1$: A 78-rpm record\n\n$\\triangleright$ In the early 20th century, the standard format for music recordings was a plastic disk that held a single song and rotated at 78 rpm (revolutions per minute). What was the angular velocity of such a disk?\n\n$\\triangleright$ If we measure angles in units of revolutions and time in units of minutes, then 78 rpm is the angular velocity. Using standard physics units of radians/second, however, we have\n\n$\\frac{78\\ \\text{revolutions}}{1\\ \\text{minute}} \\times\\frac{2\\pi\\ \\text{radians}}{1\\ \\text{revolution}} \\times\\frac{1\\ \\text{minute}}{60\\ \\text{seconds}} = 8.2\\ \\text{s}^{-1} .$\n\nIn the absence of any torque, a rigid body will rotate indefinitely with the same angular velocity. If the angular velocity is changing because of a torque, we define an angular acceleration,\n\n$\\alpha = \\dfrac{d\\omega}{dt}$\n$\\text{[definition of angular acceleration]}$\n\nT",

The File>Open command lets you read a UCINET text (DL) file (discussed elsewhere), and existing UCINET dataset, or a Pajek dataset. This menu also is used to access data that have been stored in the native data format of the NetDraw program (.VNA format). Once the data has been imported with the Open command, the node and line attribute editors of NetDraw can be used to create a diagram that can be saved with colors, shapes, locations, etc.\n\nA second method is to build a dataset within NetDraw itself. Begin by creating a random network (File>Random). This creates an arbitrary network of 20 nodes. You can then use the node attributes editor (Transform>Node Attribute editor) and the link editor (Transform>Link Editor) to modify the nodes (and add or delete nodes) and their attributes; and to create connections among nodes. This is great for small, simple networks; for more complicated data, it's best to create the basic data set elsewhere and import it.\n\nThe third method is to use an external editor to create a NetDraw dataset (a .vna file) directly. This file is a plain ascii text file (if you use a word processor, be sure to save as ascii text). The contents of the file is pretty simple, and is discussed in the brief tutorial to NetDraw.

They are sold as seeds, blends of spices, whole or ground spices, and seasonings. The aromatic substances that give a spice its particular aroma and flavor are the essential oils. The flavor of the essential oil or flavoring compound will vary depending on the quality and freshness of the spice.\n\nThe aromas of ground spices are volatile. This means they lose their odor or flavoring when left exposed to the air for extended periods. They should be stored in sealed containers when not in use. Whole beans or unground seeds have a longer shelf life but should also be stored in sealed containers.\n\nAllspice\n\nAllspice is only one spice, yet it has a flavor resembling a blend of cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. At harvest time, the mature (but still green) berries from the allspice trees (a small tropical evergreen) are\ndried in the sun. During drying they turn reddish-brown and become small berries. The berries are about\n0.6 cm (1/4 in.) in diameter and contain dark brown seeds.\n\nAllspice is grown principally in Jamaica and to a lesser degree in Mexico. Allspice is available whole or ground. Bakers usually use ground allspice in cakes, cookies, spices, and pies.\n\nAnise\n\nAnise is the small, green-grey fruit or seed of a plant of the parsley family. The plant grows to a height of 45 cm (18 in.) and has fine leaves with clusters of small white flowers. It is native to Mexico and Spain, with the latter being the principal producer. Anise seeds are added to pastries, breads, cookies, and candies.\n\nCaraway\n\nCaraway is the dried fruit or seed of a biennial plant of the parsley family, harvested every second year, primarily in the Netherlands. It is also produced in Poland and Russia. The many-branched, hollow-stemmed\nherb grows up to 60 cm (24 in.) high and has small white flowers. Caraway is a small crescent-shaped brown seed with a pleasant aroma but somewhat sharp taste. Although it is most familiar in rye bread, caraway is also used in cookies and cakes.\n\nCardamom\n\nNative to India, Sri Lanka, and Guatemala, cardamom is the fruit or seed of a plant of the ginger family. The three-sided, creamy-white, flavorless pod holds the tiny aromatic, dark brown seeds. It is available in whole and ground (pod removed). Cardamom in ground form flavors Danish pastries and coffee cakes, Christmas baking, and Easter baking such as hot cross buns.\n\nCinnamon\n\nCinnamon comes from the bark of an aromatic evergreen tree. It is native to China, Indonesia, and Indochina. Cinnamon may be purchased in ground form or as cinnamon sticks. Ground cinnamon is used in pastries, breads, puddings, cakes, candy, and cookies. Cinnamon sticks are used for preserved fruits and flavoring puddings. Cinnamon sugar is made with approximately 50 g (2 oz.) of cinnamon to 1 kg (2.2 lb.) of granulated sugar.\n\nCassia\n\nCassia, sometimes known as Chinese cinnamon, is native to Assam an",

What trade-offs do central banks face and how do they confront them?\n\nCentral banks worldwide often find themselves between a rock and a hard place. The rock is price stability (inflation control) and the hard place is economic growth and employment. Although in the long run the two goals are perfectly compatible, in the short run, they sometimes are not. In those instances, the central bank has a difficult decision to make. Should it raise interest rates or slow or even stop MS growth to stave off inflation, or should it decrease interest rates or speed up MS growth to induce companies and consumers to borrow, thereby stoking employment and growth? In some places, like the European Union, the central bank is instructed by its charter to stop inflation. “The primary objective of the European System of Central Banks,” the Maastricht Treaty clearly states, “shall be to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community” including high employment and economic growth. The Fed’s charter and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, by contrast, instruct the Fed to ensure price stability, maximum employment, and financial stability. Little wonder that the Fed has not held the line on inflation as well as the European Central Bank (ECB), but unemployment rates in the United States are generally well below those of most European nations. (There are additional reasons for that difference that are not germane to the discussion here.)\n\nDo note that almost nobody wants 100 percent employment, when everyone who wants a job has one. A little unemployment, called frictional unemployment, is a good thing because it allows the labor market to function more smoothly. So-called structural unemployment, when workers’ skills do not match job requirements, is not such a good thing, but is probably inevitable in a dynamic economy saddled with a weak educational system. (As structural unemployment increased in the United States, education improved somewhat, but not enough to ensure that all new jobs the economy created could be filled with domestic laborers.) So the Fed shoots for what is called the natural rate of unemployment. Nobody is quite sure what that rate is, but it is thought to be around 5 percent, give or take.\n\nkey takeaways\n• The main trade-off that central banks face is a short-term one between inflation, which calls for tighter policy (higher interest rates, slower money growth), and employment and output, which call for looser policy (lower interest rates, faster money growth).\n• Some central banks confront trade-offs by explicitly stating that one goal, usually price stability (controlling inflation), is of paramount concern.\n• Others, including the Fed, confront the trade-off on an ad hoc, case-by-case basis.\n\n17.03: Central Bank Targets\n\nlearning objectives\n1.

                "source_content": "In this chapter we continue the study of special relativity. Three important applications of the ideas developed in the previous chapter are made here. First, we show how to describe waves in the context of spacetime. We then see how waves which have no preferred reference frame (such as that of a medium supporting them) are constrained by special relativity to have a dispersion relation of a particular form. This dispersion relation turns out to be that of the relativistic matter waves of quantum mechanics. Second, we investigate the Doppler shift phenomenon, in which the frequency of a wave takes on different values in different coordinate systems. Third, we show how to add velocities in a relativistically consistent manner.\n\nA new mathematical idea is presented in the context of relativistic waves, namely the spacetime vector or four-vector. Writing the laws of physics totally in terms of relativistic scalars and four-vectors insures that they will be valid in all inertial reference frames. \n\n05: Applications of Special Relativity \n\nWe now look at the characteristics of waves in spacetime. Recall that a sine wave moving to the right in one space dimension can be represented by\n\n$A(x, t)=A_{0} \\sin (k x-\\omega t)\\label{5.1}$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{A}_{0}$ is the (constant) amplitude of the wave, k is the wavenumber, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and that the quantity $\\phi=k x-\\omega t$ is called the phase of the wave. For a plane wave in three space dimensions, the wave is represented in a similar way,\n\n$A(\\mathbf{x}, t)=A_{0} \\sin (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}-\\omega t)\\label{5.2}$\n\nwhere $k$ is now the position vector and $k$ is the wave vector. The magnitude of the wave vector, $|\\mathbf{k}|=\\mathrm{k}$ is just the wavenumber of the wave and the direction of this vector indicates the direction the wave is moving. The phase of the wave in this case is $\\phi=\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}-\\omega t$.\n\nIn the case of a one-dimensional wave moving to the right $\\phi=k x-\\omega t$. A wave front has constant phase $\\phi$, so solving this equation for $t$ and multiplying by $c$, the speed of light in a vacuum, gives us an equation for the world line of a wave front:\n\n$c t=\\frac{c k x}{\\omega}-\\frac{c \\phi}{\\omega}=\\frac{c x}{u_{p}}-\\frac{c \\phi}{\\omega} \\quad(\\text { wave front })\\label{5.3}$\n\nThe slope of the world line in a spacetime diagram is the coefficient of x, or $c / \\mathrm{u}_{\\mathrm{p}}, \\text { where } \\mathrm{u}_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\omega / \\mathrm{k}$ is the phase speed. The world lines of the wave fronts of a wave are illustrated in figure 5.1.\n\n5.02: Math Tutorial  Four-Vectors\n\nAlso shown in figure 5.1 is a spacetime vector or four-vector which represents the frequency and wavenumber of the wave, which we refer to as the wave four-vector.

The $\\mathrm{C–H}$ bonds have a length of $109 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$ ($109 \\mathrm{~pm}$) while the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond is approximately 50% longer, $154 \\times 10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}$ ($154 \\mathrm{~pm}$). This is because the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bonding orbital is made from $\\mathrm{sp}^{3}$ hybrid orbitals, which are larger than the $1\\mathrm{s}$ orbital that hydrogen uses to form bonds. These so-called σ (sigma) bonds have an interesting property; the atoms that they link can spin relative to each other without breaking the bond between them. For a $\\mathrm{C–H}$ bond, if the $\\mathrm{H}$ spins it would be impossible to tell, since the $\\mathrm{H}$ atom is radially symmetric around the $\\mathrm{C–H}$ bond axis. But if the carbons in the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond of ethane spin relative to each other, then it is possible to observe different arrangements by looking down the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond axis. For example:\n\nand\n\nare both representations of ethane (the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond is not seen in this depiction because you are looking straight down the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond). They appear different because the arrangement of the atoms is different in space, but in fact at room temperature these two arrangements can easily interconvert by rotating around the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond.\n\nThis raises another point to consider, namely that starting (and stopping) bond rotations requires energy. Similarly, there can be vibrations along the length of a bond, which again involves the absorption or release of energy. We will consider this further later on.[6] In the case of the rotating bond it turns out that as the bulk of the groups attached to the carbons increases the energy required for the rotation around the $\\mathrm{C–C}$ bond also increases. Big, bulky groups can bump into each other, occupying each other’s space causing electron-electron repulsions and raising the energy of any shape where the groups are too close. This tends to lock the molecule into specific orientations that can influence the compound’s physical properties. An example of how structure interferes with the formation of a molecule is a molecule containing 17 carbon atoms and 36 hydrogen atoms ($\\rightarrow$); although it is possible to draw this molecule it has never been synthesized because the atoms crowd each other, and intrude on each other’s space. It is possible, however, to synthesize molecules with the same number of carbon atoms but fewer hydrogen atoms.[7] Can you produce a plausible explanation for why?\n\nCollapsing Real Structures Down to 2-Dimensional Representations\n\nNow, an obvious problem with complex three-dimensional molecules, even those made up only of hydrogen and carbon, is how to convey their structure when they must be depicted in two dimensions, like when you are writing on paper.

Some familiar web-based examples of authoring tools include blogs (e.g., WordPress), wikis (e.g., Mediawiki), content management systems (e.g., Drupal), learning management systems (e.g., Canvas), document authoring tools (e.g., Google Docs), and video production environments (e.g., YouTube). Some other tools that are not web-based include HTML editors (e.g., Adobe Dreamweaver), video authoring tools (e.g., Camtasia Studio), and document authoring tools (e.g., Microsoft Word) that are all capable of creating content for the Web.\n\nIn addition to providing guidance on developing web content that is accessible through WCAG 2.0, the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has introduced the AuthoringToolAccessibility Guidelines (ATAG 2.0) which provide guidance for web authoring tool developers to ensure that:\n\n1. Tools are accessible to be used by people with disabilities\n2. Tools make it possible to create WCAG 2.0 conformant Web content\n\nConformance\n\nATAG 2.0 guidelines are sorted by levels of importance, much like WCAG 2.0. Because ATAG 2.0 covers tools that are not web-based, it does not specifically refer to “accessibility supported” requirements like those of WCAG 2.0 because those refer to web-based strategies that are supported by assistive technology.\n\nATAG 2.0 conformance for authoring tools is more complex than WCAG 2.0 conformance for web content, as it subsumes WCAG 2.0 and adds a range of requirements specific to authoring tools.\n\nPartial ATAG 2.0 process component conformance is also possible in cases where additional add-on components would be needed to claim full conformance. For example, if the tool does not provide accessibility checking capability (a requirement for ATAG 2.0 conformance), it can claim partial conformance if it is possible to add a plugin that provides accessibility checking. Partial conformance can also be claimed when the platform limits compliance. For example, if a tool runs on multiple operating systems, and conformance is possible on one platform (e.g., Windows) that has an add-on accessibility checking service available, but a similar service is not available for the system run on on a different platform (e.g., Linux), a platform limitation conformance claim can be made.\n\nMore details about conformance claims can be found in the ATAG 2.0 specifications itself:\n\nReadings and References: ATAG 2.0 Conformance Claims\n\nATAG 2.0 Part A\n\nPart A of ATAG 2.0 provides guidance on making the authoring tool user interface accessible. Generally speaking, these guidelines reflect WCAG 2.0 with the addition of accessibility requirements for tools that are not web-based.\n\nThe four top level guidelines in Part A are as follows:\n\n• Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines\n• Principle A.2: Editing-views are perceivable\n• Principle A.3: Editing-views are operable\n• Principle A.4: Editing-views are understandable\n\nATAG 2.0 Part B\n\nPart B of ATAG 2.0 ",

This type of water pollution can also occur naturally due to the presence of a minor and unwanted constituent, contaminant or impurity in the groundwater, in which case it is more likely referred to as contamination rather than pollution.\n\nHow Does Groundwater Become Contaminated?\n\nThe pollutant often creates a contaminant plume within an aquifer. Movement of water and dispersion within the aquifer spreads the pollutant over a wider area. Its advancing boundary, often called a plume edge, can intersect with groundwater wells or daylight into surface water such as seeps and springs, making the water supplies unsafe for humans and wildlife. The movement of the plume, called a plume front, may be analyzed through a hydrological transport model or groundwater model. Analysis of groundwater pollution may focus on soil characteristics and site geology, hydrogeology, hydrology, and the nature of the contaminants.\n\nPollution can occur from on-site sanitation systems, landfills, effluent from wastewater treatment plants, leaking sewers, petrol filling stations or from over application of fertilizers in agriculture. Pollution (or contamination) can also occur from naturally occurring contaminants, such as arsenic or fluoride. Using polluted groundwater causes hazards to public health through poisoning or the spread of disease.\n\nDifferent mechanisms have influence on the transport of pollutants, e.g. diffusion, adsorption, precipitation, decay, in the groundwater. The interaction of groundwater contamination with surface waters is analyzed by use of hydrology transport models.\n\nPollutant types\n\nContaminants found in groundwater cover a broad range of physical, inorganic chemical, organic chemical, bacteriological, and radioactive parameters. Principally, many of the same pollutants that play a role in surface water pollution may also be found in polluted groundwater, although their respective importance may differ.\n\nArsenic and fluoride\n\nArsenic and fluoride have been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the most serious inorganic contaminants in drinking-water on a worldwide basis.\n\nInorganic arsenic is the most common type of arsenic in soil and water. The metalloid arsenic can occur naturally in groundwater, as seen most frequently in Asia, including in China, India and Bangladesh. In the Ganges Plain of northern India and Bangladesh severe contamination of groundwater by naturally occurring arsenic affects 25% of water wells in the shallower of two regional aquifers. Groundwater in these areas is also contaminated by the use of arsenic-based pesticides.\n\nArsenic in groundwater can also be present where there are mining operations or mine waste dumps that will leach arsenic.\n",

Other functions, like `print_twice`, perform an action but don’t return a value. They are called void functions.\n\nWhen you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result; for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:\n\n```x = math.cos(radians)\ngolden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2\n```\n\nWhen you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:\n\n```>>> math.sqrt(5)\n2.2360679774997898\n```\n\nBut in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever!\n\n```math.sqrt(5)\n```\n\nThis script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store or display the result, it is not very useful.\n\nVoid functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don’t have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called `None`.\n\n```>>> result = print_twice('Bing')\nBing\nBing\n>>> print result\nNone\n```\n\nThe value `None` is not the same as the string `'None'`. It is a special value that has its own type:\n\n```>>> print type(None)\n<type 'NoneType'>\n```\n\nThe functions we have written so far are all void. We will start writing fruitful functions in a few chapters.\n\n16.12: Why Functions?\n\nIt may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:\n\n• Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n• Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n• Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n• Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.\n\n16.13: Importing with from\n\nPython provides two ways to import modules; we have already seen one:\n\n```>>> import math\n>>> print math\n<module 'math' (built-in)>\n>>> print math.pi\n3.14159265359\n```\n\nIf you import `math`, you get a module object named `math`. The module object contains constants like `pi` and functions like `sin` and `exp`.\n\nBut if you try to access `pi` directly, you get an error.\n\n```>>> print pi\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'pi' is not defined\n```\n\nAs an alternative, you can import an object from a module like this:\n\n```>>> from math import pi\n```\n\nNow you can access `pi` directly, without dot notation.\n\n```>>> print pi\n3.14159265359\n```\n\nOr you can use the star operator to import everything from the module:\n\n```>>> from math import *\n>>> cos(pi)\n-1.0\n```\n\nThe advantage of importing everything from the math module is that your code can be more concise.

Consider the circuit shown in Figure 8.4.1 . Note the use of a voltage source rather than a fixed current source, as examined earlier.\n\nFigure 8.4.1 : A simple RC circuit.\n\nThe key to the analysis is to remember that capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously. Assuming the capacitor is uncharged, the instant power is applied, the capacitor voltage must be zero. Therefore all of the source voltage drops across the resistor. This creates the initial current, and this current starts to charge the capacitor (the initial rate being equal to $i/C$ as dictated by Equation 8.2.6). According to Kirchhoff's voltage law, as the capacitor voltage begins to increase, the resistor voltage must decrease because the sum of the two must equal the fixed source voltage. This means that the circulating current must also decrease. This, in turn, means that the rate of capacitor voltage increase begins to slow. As the capacitor voltage continues to increase, less voltage is available for the resistor, causing further reductions in current, and a further slowing of the rate of capacitor voltage change. Eventually, the capacitor voltage will be nearly equal to the source voltage. This will result in a very small potential across the resistor and an equally small current, slowing subsequent capacitor voltage increases to a near standstill. Theoretically, the capacitor voltage approaches the source voltage but never quite equals it. Similarly, the current drops to near zero, but never completely turns off. This is illustrated in Figure 8.4.2 .\n\nFigure 8.4.2 : Normalized charge and discharge curves.\n\nThe dashed red line represents the initial rate of change of capacitor voltage. This trajectory is what would be expected if an ideal current source drove the capacitor, as in Example 8.2.4. As noted previously, the rate of voltage change versus times is equal to $i/C$, and therefore in this case, $E/RC$. If the initial rate of change were to continue unabated, the source voltage, $E$, would be reached in $RC$ seconds. Consequently, RC is referred to as the charge time constant and is denoted by $\\tau$ (Greek letter tau). Thus,\n\n$\\text{Time constant, } \\tau = RC \\label{8.10}$\n\nAs noted, once the capacitor begins to charge, the current begins to decrease and the capacitor voltage curve begins to fall away from the initial trajectory. The solid red curve represents the capacitor voltage. Notice that after five time constants the capacitor is nearly fully charged and the circuit is considered to be in steady-state (i.e., the capacitor behaves as an open).\n\n$\\text{Steady-state is reached in approximately five time constants.} \\label{8.11}$\n\nThis sort of recursively dependent operation is characteristic of exponential functions.

Ring-opening reactions can proceed by either SN2 or SN1 mechanisms, depending on the nature of the epoxide and on the reaction conditions. If the epoxide is asymmetric, the structure of the product will vary according to which mechanism dominates. When an asymmetric epoxide undergoes solvolysis in basic methanol, ring-opening occurs by an SN2 mechanism, and the less substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under steric considerations and produces product B in the example below.\n\nConversely, when solvolysis occurs in acidic methanol, the reaction occurs by a mechanism with substantial SN1 character, and the more substituted carbon reacts with the nucleophile under electrostatic considerations and produces product A in the example below.\n\nThese are both good examples of regioselective reactions. In a regioselective reaction, two (or more) different constitutional isomers are possible as products, but one is formed preferentially (or sometimes exclusively).\n\nLet us examine the basic, SN2 case first. The leaving group is an alkoxide anion, because there is no acid available to protonate the oxygen prior to ring opening. An alkoxide is a poor leaving group, and thus the ring is unlikely to open without a 'push' from the nucleophile.\n\nThe nucleophile itself is potent: a deprotonated, negatively charged methoxide ion. When a nucleophilic substitution reaction involves a poor leaving group and a powerful nucleophile, it is very likely to proceed by an SN2 mechanism.\n\nWhat about the electrophile? There are two electrophilic carbons in the epoxide, but the best target for the nucleophile in an SN2 reaction is the carbon that is least hindered. This accounts for the observed regiochemical outcome. Like in other SN2 reactions, nucleophilic reactions take place with backside orientation relative to the leaving group, resulting in inversion at the electrophilic carbon.\n\nProbably the best way to depict the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening reaction is as a hybrid, or cross, between an SN2 and SN1 mechanism. First, the oxygen is protonated, creating a good leaving group (step 1 below) . Electrostatic considerations have greater importance with a protonated intermediate. As the carbon-oxygen bond begins to break (step 2), positive charge builds on the more substituted carbon with greater carbocation stability.\n\nUnlike in an SN1 reaction, the nucleophile reacts with the electrophilic carbon (step 3) before a complete carbocation intermediate has a chance to form.\n\nReaction takes place preferentially from the backside (like in an SN2 reaction) because the carbon-oxygen bond is still to some degree in place, and the oxygen blocks reaction from the fron",

                "source_content": "Identifying your primary, secondary, and hidden audiences\n\nYour audience is the person or people you want to communicate with. By knowing more about them (their wants, needs, values, etc.), you are able to better craft your message so that they will receive it the way you intended.\n\nYour success as a communicator partly depends on how well you can tailor your message to your audience.\n\nYour primary audience is your intended audience; it is the person or people you have in mind when you decide to communicate something. However, when analyzing your audience you must also beware of your secondary audience. These are other people you could reasonably expect to come in contact with your message. For example, you might send an email to a customer, who, in this case, is your primary audience, and copy (cc:) your boss, who would be your secondary audience. Beyond these two audiences, you also have to consider your hidden audience, which are people who you may not have intended to come in contact with your audience (or message) at all, such as a colleague who gets a forwarded copy of your email.\n\nAttribution\n\nThis chapter is an adaptation of Part 1: Foundations in the Professional Communications OER by the Olds College OER Development Team and is used under a CC-BY 4.0 International license.

Standard demographic variables include a person’s age, gender, family status, education, occupation, income, and ethnicity. Each of these variables or characteristics can provide clues about how a person might respond to a message.\n\nFor example, people of different ages consume (use) media and social media differently. According to the Pew Research Center (2018), 81% of people aged 18-29 use Facebook, 64% use Instagram, and 40% use Twitter. In contrast, 65% of people aged 50-64 use Facebook, 21% use Instagram, and 19% use Twitter (Pew Research Center, 2018). If I were trying to market my product to those aged 50-64, I would likely reach a larger audience (and potentially make more sales) if I used targeted ads on Facebook rather than recruiting brand ambassadors on Instagram. Knowing the age (or ages) of your audience(s) can help inform what channels you use to send your message. It can also help you determine the best way to structure and tailor your message to meet specific audience characteristics.\n\nReference\n\nPew Research Center. (2018). Social media fact sheet.

This occurs because in our.classical Ohmic model in Section 3-2-2c one species of charge (e.g., electrons in metals) move relative to a stationary background species of charge with opposite polarity so that charge neutrality is maintained. However, if only one species of charge is injected into a medium, a net steady-state volume charge distribution can result.\n\nBecause of the electric force, this distribution of volume charge $\\rho_{f}$ contributes to and also in turn depends on the electric field. It now becomes necessary to simultaneously satisfy the coupled electrical and mechanical equations\n\n3-7-1 Space Charge Limited Vacuum Tube Diode\n\nIn vacuum tube diodes, electrons with charge -e and mass m are boiled off the heated cathode, which we take as our zero potential reference. This process is called thermionic emission. A positive potential Vo applied to the anode at x = l accelerates the electrons, as in Figure 3-26.\n\nNewton's law for a particular electron is\n\n$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = - eE = e \\frac{dV}{dx}$\n\nIn the dc steady state the velocity of the electron depends only on its position x so that\n\n$m \\frac{dv}{dt} = m \\frac{dv}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dt} = mv \\frac{dv}{dx} \\Rightarrow \\frac{d}{dx}( \\frac{1}{2} mv^{2}) = \\frac{d}{dx}(eV)$\n\nWith this last equality, we have derived the energy conservation theorem\n\n$\\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - eV] = 0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} mv^{2} - eV = \\textrm{const}$\n\nwhere we say that the kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ plus the potential energy -eV is the constant total energy. We limit ourselves here to the simplest case where the injected charge at the cathode starts out with zero velocity. Since the potential is also chosen to be zero at the cathode, the constant in (3) is zero.

                "source_content": "In this section, we consider the behavior of charge and the electric field in the vicinity of a perfect electrical conductor (PEC).\n\nFirst, note that the electric field – both the electric field intensity $\\bf{E}$ and electric flux density $\\bf{D}$ – throughout a PEC region is zero. This is because the electrical potential throughout a PEC region must be constant. (This idea is explored further in Section 6.3). Recall that the electric field is proportional to the spatial rate of change of electrical potential (i.e., ${\\bf E}=-\\nabla V$; Section 5.14). Thus, the electric field must be zero throughout a PEC region.\n\nSecond, the electric field is oriented directly away from (i.e., perpendicular to) the PEC surface, and the magnitude of ${\\bf D}$ is equal to the surface charge density $\\rho_s$ (C/m$^2$) (Section 5.18).\n\nNow we address the question of charge distribution; i.e., the location and density of charge. Consider the scenario shown in Figure $1$.\n\nHere, a flat slab of PEC material is embedded in dielectric material.1 The thickness of the slab is finite, whereas the length and width of the slab is infinite. The region above the slab is defined as Region 1 and has permittivity $\\epsilon_1$. The region below the slab is defined as Region 2 and has permittivity $\\epsilon_2$. Electric fields ${\\bf E}_1$ and ${\\bf E}_2$ are present in Regions 1 and 2, respectively, as shown in Figure $1$. To begin, let us assume that these fields are the result of some external stimulus that results in the direction of these fields being generally upward, as shown in Figure $1$.\n\nNow, what do we know about ${\\bf E}_1$ and ${\\bf E}_2$? First, both fields must satisfy the relevant boundary conditions. That is, the component of ${\\bf E}_1$ that is tangent to the upper PEC surface is zero, so that ${\\bf E}_1$ is directed entirely in a direction perpendicular to the surface. Similarly, the component of ${\\bf E}_2$ that is tangent to the lower PEC surface is zero, so that ${\\bf E}_2$ is directed entirely in a direction perpendicular to the surface. At this point we have not determined the magnitudes or signs of ${\\bf E}_1$ and ${\\bf E}_2$; we have established only that there are no non-zero components tangential to (i.e., parallel to) the PEC surfaces.\n\nNext, recall that the electric field must be zero within the slab. This means that there must be zero net charge within the slab, since any other distribution of charge will result in a non-zero electric field, and subsequently a potential difference between locations within the slab. Therefore:\n\nThere can be no static charge within a PEC.\n\nIt follows that\n\nCharge associated with a PEC lies entirely on the surface.\n\nOutside the slab, the boundary conditions on ${\\bf D}_1$ and ${\\bf D}_2$ in the dielectric regions require these fields to be non-zero when the surface charge density on the PEC is non-zero. The surface charge supports the discontinuity in the normal component of the electric fields. Specifically, ${\\bf D}_1$",

Accordingly these ions participate in $S_\\text{N}2$ reactions with suitable alkyl compounds:\n\nHowever, there are a number of complicating factors to consider. First, the basic conditions needed to form the enolate ions often lead to side reactions such as aldol addition and $E2$ elimination of $\\ce{RX}$ compounds. Aldol addition is minimized if the carbonyl compound is a ketone with a structure unfavorable for aldol addition or if all of the carbonyl compound is converted to its enolate. To convert all of a simple carbonyl to its enolate usually requires a very strong base, such as $\\ce{NH_2^+}$ in an aprotic solvent or liquid ammonia. Because the enolate anion itself is a strong base, best results are obtained when the halide, $\\ce{RX}$, does not undergo $E2$ reactions readily.\n\nThe second complication arises if the alkyl compound reacts with both carbon and oxygen of the nucleophilic enolate anion. The carbon product is the result of \"$\\ce{C}$-alkylation\", whereas the oxygen product is the result of \"$\\ce{O}$-alkylation\":\n\nThe possibility of the enolate anion acting as if its charge were effectively concentrated on carbon or on oxygen was discussed previously in connection with aldol addition (Section 17-3B). However, the situation there was quite different from the one here, because aldol addition is easily reversible, whereas alkylation is not. Furthermore, while the aldol reaction involving $\\ce{C-O}$ bond formation is unfavorable $\\left( \\Delta H^0 = + 20 \\: \\text{kcal mol}^{-1} \\right)$ compared to $\\ce{C-C}$ bond formation $\\left( \\Delta H^0 = - 4 \\: \\text{kcal mol}^{-1} \\right)$, both $\\ce{O}$- and $\\ce{C}$-alkylation of the anion have $\\Delta H^0 < 0$.\n\nWhether $\\ce{C}$- or $\\ce{O}$-alkylation predominates depends on kinetic control (Section 10-4A). It is not a simple matter to predict which of the two positions of the enolate will be more nucleophilic, and in fact, mixtures of products often are obtained in distributions that depend on the solvent used, the temperature, the nature of $\\ce{X}$, and the nature of the base employed to form the anion. $\\ce{O}$-Alkylation tends to occur with ketones of high enol content (which usually means that the enolate anion will have especially high charge density on oxygen) and with alkylating agents possessing a high degree of $S_\\text{N}2$ reactivity.\n\nThere is another correlation that seems to have validity in many situations, at least where kinetic control is dominant; namely, the freer (less associated) the ambident anions is from its cation, the more likely is the electrophile to attack the atom of the anion with the highest negative charge. Thus $\\ce{O}$-alkylation of the sodium enolate of 2-propanone is favored in aprotic solvents that are good at solvating cations [such as $\\ce{(CH_3)_2SO}$, Section 8-7F].\n\nIn the alkylation of unsymmetrical ketones, formation of more than",

He was mistaken, and the Spanish struggled for hundreds of years to subjugate and convert the indigenous people of the Americas. When they did not cooperate, they were often either slaughtered and maimed, or enslaved to work for the Spanish colonists. King Ferdinand, receiving firsthand accounts of the barbaric ways these people were treated, sought to legitimize Spain’s actions in the eyes of the church and the Pope. The Requerimiento was one of these attempts.\n\nThe Requerimiento was a document written in 1510 (according to most sources) by Juan López de Palacios Rubios, acting in his capacity as a member of the Royal Council of Castile. Rubios was a doctor, a judge, and the King’s chief jurist. He was also very involved in Spanish politics. The Requerimiento was written with the expectation that it would be read by conquistadors to indigenous people they encountered in their conquest of new lands.\n\nJuan López de Palacios Rubios was born Juan Lopez de Vivero. (He was later referred to as Palacios Rubios instead of ViVero because he was born in the province of Salamanca, Spain, known at the time as “Palaciosrubios”.) Rubios was a well-known and respected jurist who was advisor to the king and wrote several works upholding the legality of the Spanish actions in the New World. His treatise “Of the Ocean Isles” (circa 1512) used the writings of Hostiensis, a 13th century bishop, to justify Spain’s subjugation of “pagans” in defense of Christianity.\n\nPope Alexander VI had already granted Spain and Portugal power over newly discovered lands. Spain had claimed lands in Central and South America and the Caribbean in 1493 following Columbus’ return. In exchange for this power, the Pope expected the Spanish colonists to convert the indigenous people of these lands to Christianity, a duty that the clergy took very seriously. The colonists, however, were often more concerned with their businesses, and the free labor of the Native Americans increased their profits. The workers were forced into labor, and were often mistreated and abused. Many missionaries accompanied the Spanish settlers, and they were the first to speak up about the atrocities they witnessed against the indigenous inhabitants (see Bartolomeo de las Casas).\n\nKing Ferdinand II of Spain struggled with how to further the cause of Christianity in a way that did not go against the tenets of the church. There were already a number of political rationales for Spanish conquest of new lands, the strongest being that Christians could acquire lands and obtain power over the “pagan” inhabitants for the purpose of disseminating Chritianity. The King eventually turned to the Council of Castile for their help.\n\nThe Council knew that the conquistadors were pursuing a violent course of action when ",

In its pure form, potassium has a white-sliver color, but quickly oxidizes upon exposure to air and tarnishing in minutes if it is not stored under oil or grease. Potassium is essential to several aspects of plant, animal, and human life and is thus mined, manufactured, and consumed in huge quantities around the world.\n\nThe seventh most abundant element, potassium was discovered and isolated in 1807 by Sir Humphry Davy. Important compounds of potassium include potassium hydroxide (used in some drain cleaners), potassium superoxide, $KO_2$, which is used in respiratory equipment and potassium nitrate, used in fertilizers and pyrotechnics. Potassium, like sodium, melts below the boiling point of water (63 °C) and is less dense than water also. Like most of the alkali metals, potassium compounds impart a characteristic color to flames. In the case of the 19th element, the color is pale lavender.

One of the characteristics of a military environment is loyalty and camaraderie: loyalty to other members of the agency, loyalty to the system of rank structure, and loyalty to the values possessed by the agency. Correction guards and other law enforcement personnel work most of their careers in an unsafe environment, in which they have to rely on one another for their safety. In this context, when a law enforcement member is in danger, that member must be secure in the belief that fellow members will be loyal to him or her, even in dangerous situations or situations involving emotional risk. Loyalty is critical for ensuring law enforcement members understand that their colleagues will be willing to ignore danger and assist them regardless of the peril. Without loyalty and camaraderie, law enforcement personnel would be ineffective as they would likely be reluctant to put themselves in harm’s way.\n\nPolice investigators for one agency often assist other investigators in different agencies. Part of this compelling duty to assist in an investigation is because of a sense of loyalty to other members of the same profession. The loyalty felt by officers fosters teamwork in investigations and in general duty or patrol work. Loyalty and teamwork in all branches of law enforcement are critical in preventing crime, investigating crime, and guarding prisoners.\n\nWhile loyalty is important, there are limitations; officers should be aware of how far their loyalty extends before they report misconduct. Westmarland (2010) surveyed police officers about corruption and the “blue code” of silence. Specifically, Westmarland sought the following:\n\n• What officers think about violations of rules\n• When to inform superiors of rule breaking\n• Whether informing superiors of rule breaking is just as bad as the behaviour of the original rule breaker\n• Behaviour the officer would definitely not report on\n• What the appropriate punishment would be for each sort of behaviour\n\nThe survey included scenarios that ranged in seriousness from off-duty business interests to theft and assault. Scenarios varied and included themes that were acquisitive (where greed was the motivating factor, such as theft), administrative or internal disciplinary infringements (rule bending), and noble cause corruption. The survey was administered to 171 serving police officers in the United Kingdom. Based on the survey results, Westmarland concluded the following:\n\n• Acquisitive cases were regarded by the officers as being the most serious.\n• Officers in judging acquisitive cases severely depended largely on the perceived dollar amount that was taken.\n• It is not clear whether the money amount, or the way the money/property was taken, is correlated to the perceived seriousness of the case.\n• Of the acquisitive scenarios, taking bribes (95% of respondents), s",

Ring-opening reactions can proceed by either SN2 or SN1 mechanisms, depending on the nature of the epoxide and on the reaction conditions. If the epoxide is asymmetric, the structure of the product will vary according to which mechanism dominates. When an asymmetric epoxide undergoes solvolysis in basic methanol, ring-opening occurs by an SN2 mechanism, and the less substituted carbon is the site of nucleophilic attack, leading to what we will refer to as product B:\n\nConversely, when solvolysis occurs in acidic methanol, the reaction occurs by a mechanism with substantial SN1 character, and the more substituted carbon is the site of attack. As a result, product A predominates.\n\nThese are both good examples of regioselective reactions. In a regioselective reaction, two (or more) different constitutional isomers are possible as products, but one is formed preferentially (or sometimes exclusively).\n\nLet us examine the basic, SN2 case first. The leaving group is an alkoxide anion, because there is no acid available to protonate the oxygen prior to ring opening. An alkoxide is a poor leaving group, and thus the ring is unlikely to open without a 'push' from the nucleophile.\n\nThe nucleophile itself is potent: a deprotonated, negatively charged methoxide ion. When a nucleophilic substitution reaction involves a poor leaving group and a powerful nucleophile, it is very likely to proceed by an SN2 mechanism.\n\nWhat about the electrophile? There are two electrophilic carbons in the epoxide, but the best target for the nucleophile in an SN2 reaction is the carbon that is least hindered. This accounts for the observed regiochemical outcome. Like in other SN2 reactions, nucleophilic attack takes place from the backside, resulting in inversion at the electrophilic carbon.\n\nProbably the best way to depict the acid-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening reaction is as a hybrid, or cross, between an SN2 and SN1 mechanism. First, the oxygen is protonated, creating a good leaving group (step 1 below) . Then the carbon-oxygen bond begins to break (step 2) and positive charge begins to build up on the more substituted carbon (recall the discussion from section 8.4B about carbocation stability).\n\nUnlike in an SN1 reaction, the nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon (step 3) before a complete carbocation intermediate has a chance to form.\n\nAttack takes place preferentially from the backside (like in an SN2 reaction) because the carbon-oxygen bond is still to some degree in place, and the oxygen blocks attack from the front side. Notice, however, how the regiochemical outcome is different from the base-catalyzed reaction: in the acid-catalyzed process, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it is this carbon that holds a greater de",

                "source_content": "by\n\nThis full-page illumination is one of twenty-four from a manuscript of the Gospel that reflects Ethiopia’s longstanding Christian heritage. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church was established in the fourth century by King Ezana (who ruled 320–350). He adopted Christianity as the official state religion of Aksum, a kingdom located in the highlands of present-day Ethiopia. As the Christian state expanded over the centuries, monasteries were founded throughout the region. These became important centers of learning and artistic production, as well as influential outposts of state power.\n\nThe manuscript was created at a monastic center near Lake Tana in the early fifteenth century. It is composed of 178 leaves of vellum bound between acacia wood covers. The illuminations depict scenes from the life of Christ and portraits of the Evangelists. This text and its pictorial format are based upon manuscripts produced by the Coptic Church. Here, however, these prototypes are transformed into local forms of expression. For example, the imagery is two-dimensional and linear, which is characteristic of Ethiopian painting. Additionally, the text is inscribed not in its original Greek, but in Ge’ez, the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia. Ge’ez is one of the world’s oldest writing systems and is the foundation of today’s Amharic, Ethiopia’s national language.\n\nIn this depiction of the Ascension of Christ into heaven, he appears framed in a red circle at the summit, surrounded by the four beasts of the Evangelists. Below, Mary and the Apostles gesture upward. The stylistic conventions seen here, such as the abbreviated definition of facial features and boldly articulated figures, are consistent throughout the manuscript, suggesting the hand of a single artist. The artist depicts the figures’ heads frontally and their bodies frequently in profile. The use of red, yellow, green, and blue as the predominant color scheme is typical of Ethiopian manuscripts from this period. The images were intended to be viewed during liturgical processions.\n\nThe Gospels were considered among the most holy of Christian texts by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Such manuscripts were often commissioned by wealthy patrons for presentation as gifts to churches. While the text demonstrated the erudition of its monastic creator, the elaborate ornamentation reflected the prestige of the benefactors. Many works of Ethiopian art were destroyed by Islamic incursions during the sixteenth century, making this manuscript a rare survivor.\n\n© 2006 The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (by permission)\n\n6.2.03: Julie Mehretu Stadia II\n\nby\n\nOpening / Ceremonies\n\nWhen looking at Stadia II, first try to isolate the black lines from the rest of the composition.

                "source_content": "We saw how to score and decode an HMM-generated sequence in two different ways. However, these methods assumed that we already knew the emission and transition probabilities. While we are always free to hazard a guess at these, we may sometimes want to use a more data-driven, empirical approach to deriving these parameters. Fortunately, the HMM framework enables the learning of these probabilities when provided a set of training data and a set architecture for the model.\n\nWhen the training data is labelled, estimation of the probabilities is a form of supervised learning. One such instance would occur if we were given a DNA sequence of one million nucleotides in which the CpG islands had all been experimentally annotated and were asked to use this to estimate our model parameters.\n\nIn contrast, when the training data is unlabelled, the estimation problem is a form of unsupervised learning. Continuing with the CpG island example, this situation would occur if the provided DNA sequence contained no island annotation whatsoever and we needed to both estimate model parameters and identify\n\nthe islands.\n\nSupervised Learning\n\nWhen provided with labelled data, the idea of estimating model parameters is straightforward. Suppose that you are given a labelled sequence x1, . . . , xN as well as the true hidden state sequence π1, . . . , πN. Intuitively, one might expect that the probabilities that maximize the data’s likelihood are the actual probabilities that one observes within the data. This is indeed the case and can be formalized by defining Akl to be the number of times hidden state k transitions to l and Ek(b) to be the number of times b is emitted from hidden state k. The parameters θ that maximize P(x|θ) are simply obtained by counting as follows:\n\n\\begin{aligned} a_{k l} &=\\frac{A_{k l}}{\\sum_{i} A_{k i}} \\ e_{k}(b) &=\\frac{E_{k}(b)}{\\sum_{c} E_{k}(c)} \\end{aligned}\n\nOne example training set is shown in Figure 8.5. In this example, it is obvious that the probability of transitioning from B to P is $\\frac{1}{3+1}=\\frac{1}{4}$ (there are 3 B to B transitions and 1 B to P transitions) and the probability of emitting a G from the B state is $\\frac{2}{2+2+1}=\\frac{2}{5}$ (there are 2 G's emitted from the B state, 2 C's and 1 A)\n\nNotice, however, that in the above example the emission probability of character T from state B is 0because no such emissions were encountered in the training set. A zero probability, either for transitioning or emitting, is particularly problematic because it leads to an infinite log penalty. In reality, however, the zero probability may merely have arisen due to over-fitting or a small sample size. To rectify this issue and maintain flexibility within our model, we can collect more data on which to train, reducing the possibility that the zero probability is due to a small sample size. Another possibility is to use ’pseudocounts’ instead of absolute counts: artificially adding some number of counts to our training data which",

The first thing we can do is write down equations of motion: an equation that describes the motion of a particle due to the action of a certain type of force. For example, suppose you take a rock of a certain mass m and let go of it at some height h above the ground, then what will happen? Once you’ve let go of the rock, there is only one force acting on the rock, namely Earth’s gravity, and we are well within the regime where Equation 2.2.2 applies, so we know the force. We also know that this net force will result in a change of momentum (Equation 2.1.4), which, because the rock won’t lose any mass in the process of falling, can be rewritten as Equation 2.1.5. By equating the forces we arrive at an equation of motion for the rock, which in this case is very simple:\n\n$m \\boldsymbol{g}=m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{x}} \\label{rock}$\n\nWe immediately see that the mass of the rock does not matter (Galilei was right! - though of course he was in our set of axioms, because we arrived at them by assuming he was right...). Less trivially, Equation (\\ref{rock}) is a second-order differential equation for the motion of the rock, which means that in order to find the actual motion, we need two initial conditions - which in our present example are that the rock starts at height h and zero velocity.\n\nEquation (\\ref{rock}) is essentially one-dimensional - all motion occurs along the vertical line. Solving it is therefore straightforward - you simply integrate over time twice. The general solution is:\n\n$\\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\\boldsymbol{x}(0)+\\boldsymbol{v}(0) t+\\frac{1}{2} \\boldsymbol{g} t^{2}$\n\nwhich with our boundary conditions becomes\n\n$\\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\\left(h-\\frac{1}{2} g t^{2}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} \\label{soln}$\n\nwhere $g$ is the magnitude of $g$ (which points down, hence the minus sign). Of course Equation \\ref{soln} breaks down when the rock hits the ground at $t=\\sqrt{2h \\over g}$, which is easily understood because at that point gravity is no longer the only force acting on it.\n\nWe can also immediately write down the equation of motion for a mass on a spring (no gravity at present), in which the net force is given by Hooke’s law. Equating that force to the net force in Newton’s second law of motion gives:\n\n$-k \\boldsymbol{x}(t)=m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{x}}(t) \\label{spring}$\n\nOf course, we find another second-order differential equation, so we again need the initial position and velocity to specify a solution. The general solution of Equation \\ref{spring} is a combination of sines and cosines, with a frequency $\\omega=\\sqrt{k \\over m}$ (as we already know from the dimensional analysis in Section 1.2):\n\n$\\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\\boldsymbol{x}(0) \\cos (\\omega t)+\\frac{\\boldsymbol{v}(0)}{\\omega} \\sin (\\omega t)$\n\nWe’ll study this case in more",

Sarvodaya means \"the awakening and welfare of all.\" Animating every phase of the movement is an awakening to Buddhist values creatively reinterpreted in a way that makes their relevance to lived social relationships more apparent and their meaning more readily implemented by all. Present suffering, for example, is not regarded primarily as a private concern of the individual and the fated product of choices in past lives as in much of conventional Buddhism; rather is it seen as a concern of the whole community. As such, suffering is regarded as something that locally coordinated effort can do something to alleviate. In other words, as Sarvodaya understands it, the Dhamma of the Buddha is concerned with bringing an end to suffering and has a unique orientation to how it should be done. Members of Sarvodaya are committed to implementing that vision in a social way.\n\nDorothy Day and the Catholic Worker movement that she and Peter Maurin founded are presented as a Christian example of the way of right action. In the heart of urban America the Catholic Worker movement attempts to articulate and embody a social vision grounded in the Christian Gospel that is radically alternative to the dominant social order-a vision of a society organized around respect for each person. The Catholic Worker Movement envisions a society made up of voluntary, self-sustaining communities of sharing and mutual aid, where no one starves or goes homeless, where violence and coercion have no place, and where change comes from first changing oneself and then changing the lives of others by the moral force of example and nonviolent action. Not content merely to hold up this vision and call for changes in the existing order, from the beginning Catholic Workers have put flesh on their ideas through concrete acts of mercy to individual persons, starting soup kitchens, establishing some forty houses of hospitality, and organizing a dozen farm communes. Voluntary poverty, service to the poor, and radical pacificism-all in the service of Christ-have kept the movement small but simultaneously have given it a profoundly influential status as a voice of conscience for American Christianity.\n\n11.04: Study Questions on Similarities and Differences\n\nThese two examples of religiously motivated social activism, the Sarvodaya Movement and the Catholic Worker Movement, possess a number of remarkable similarities as well as differences.

Most organic acids are weak acids with a small Ka. For example, acetic acid CH3COOH has a Ka of 1.8×10-5. Lots of other organic acids are even weaker than acetic acid, and it is this weak acidity that makes it difficult to realize that some organic compounds are actually acids.\n\nHowever, this weak acidity is very important in Organic Chemistry. Since it is not that very convenient to say or to remember Ka values like 1.8×10-5, pKa is used more often in Organic Chemistry to refer to the relative acidity of different acids. The definition of pKa is:\n\npKa = -logKa\n\nThe smaller the pKa value, the larger the Ka, and the stronger the acidity is.\n\nThe pKa of most organic acids range between 5~60. While it is impossible to know the pKa of every organic compound, it is very useful to understand the pKa (and acidity) based on the functional groups involved, because the same functional groups usually have similar pKas. The approximate ranges of pKa values for seven major functional groups are listed in Table 3.1, which serves as a very valuable starting point for us to predict and understand the acidity of any organic molecule. The strongest organic acid listed here is carboxylic acid, with a pKa of about 5; the weakest organic acids are the alkanes with pKa values of over 50. Since approximate ranges of pKa values are listed in the table, the exact pKa value of a group varies for different compounds because of the structural differences. Fortunately however, it is usually not necessary to know the exact pKa values for most cases in organic chemistry, and the approximate range is good enough.\n\n• Acidity is the ability of a compound to donate H+, so when we talk about the acidity (Ka and pKa) of an organic compound, it must be about a specific H atom (highlighted blue in the table). For different H atoms in the same compound, the acidity and pKa are different. As for the example of methanol:\n• It is very useful to memorize the approximate ranges of pKa listed in Table 3.1.\n• The acidity of the functional groups in the table decreases from top to the bottom, and the basicity of the conjugate bases in the last column increases from top to bottom, because the stronger the acid, the weaker the conjugate base is.\n\nPredict the Outcome of Organic Acid-Base Reaction — Use pKa as Criterion\n\nWith the knowledge of acidity and pKa, we are now ready to see how to apply this information to the understanding of organic reactions from an acid-base perspective.\n\nThe following reaction is an example in Section 3.2. If you take a closer look at the reactants and products, you will find that the “product” side also contains an acid (ammonia NH3), and a base (methoxide CH3O). Now the question is, how can we be so sure that the reaction proceeds to the “product” side as written? The question can also be asked in a different way: if equilibrium is e",

                "source_content": "Insect (Drosophila) and frog (Xenopus) development passes through three rather different (although often overlapping) phases: (1) establishing the main axes (dorsal-ventral; anterior-posterior; left-right). This is done by gradients of mRNAs and proteins encoded by the mother's genes and placed in the egg by her. (2) Establishing the main body parts such as the notochord and central nervous system in vertebrates and the segments in Drosophila These are run by genes of the zygote itself.\n\nNow let us look for clues as to how the final working out of the embryo is done. We shall examine four examples:\n\n1. the formation of wings (in Drosophila)\n2. the formation of legs (also in Drosophila)\n3. the formation of the bones (radius and ulna) of the front limb in mammals (mice)\n4. the formation of eyes (probably in all animals)\n\nWings\n\nThe insect body plan consists of head, thorax, and abdomen. The thorax is built from three segments, T1, T2, and T3. Each carries a pair of legs; hence insects are six-legged creatures. In most of the insect orders, T2 and T3 each carry a pair of wings (the honeybee is an example). However, flies belong to the insect order diptera; they have only a single pair of wings (on T2). The third thoracic segment, T3, carries instead a pair of balancing organs called halteres.\n\nIn Drosophila, a gene called Ultrabithorax (Ubx) acts within the cells of T3 to suppress the formation of wings. By creating a double mutation in the Ultrabithorax gene (in its introns, as it turned out), Professor E. B. Lewis of Caltech was able to produce flies in which the halteres had been replaced by a second pair of wings. Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is an example of a \"selector gene\". Selector genes are genes that regulate (turning on or off) the expression of other genes. Thus selector genes act as \"master switches\" in development.\n\nWings and all their associated structures are complicated pieces of machinery. Nonetheless, mutations in a single gene, were able to cause the reprogramming of the building of T3 (and deprived the flies of their ability to fly). Selector genes encode transcription factors. Ultrabithorax encodes a transcription factor that is normally expressed at high levels in T3 (as well as in the first abdominal segment) of Drosophila.\n\nThese photographs were taken by, and kindly supplied by, Professor Lewis. He has spent his entire career studying selector genes in Drosophila. His life's work was honored when he shared the 1995 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.\n\nLegs\n\nAnother selector gene, called Antennapedia (Antp), is normally turned \"on\" (expressed) in the thorax and turned \"off\" (repressed) in the cells of the head. However, mutations in Antp can cause it to turn on in the head and form a pair of legs where the antennae would normally be.\n\nWhen you consider the many genes that must be involved in building a complex structure like an insect leg (or wing), it is remarkable that a single gene can switch them all on. It is also clear tha",

It is useful for students even at the general chemistry level to have some understanding of the experimental techniques that have informed what you have already learned about kinetics.\n\nThe time domain of chemical kinetics\n\nKinetics deals with rates of change, so as a preface to this section, it is useful to consider the range of times within which the study of chemical processes takes place. Prior to about 1945, the practical range for kinetic investigations began at about 103 sec and extended out to around 108 sec, this upper limit being governed by the length of time that a graduate student (who usually does the actual work) can expect to get a Ph.D. degree. The development of flash photolysis and flow methods in the mid-1940s moved the lower time limit down to the millisecond range. The most dramatic changes began to occur in the 1970s as the availablity of lasers capable of very short-lived pulses and fast electronics gradually opened up the study of reactions that are completed in nanoseconds, picoseconds, and even femtoseconds (10–15 sec).\n\nThe basic way of obtaining the information needed to determine rate constants and reaction orders is to bring the reactants together and then measure successive changes in concentration of one of the components as a function of time. Two important requirements are\n\n• The time required to take a measurement must be very short compared to the time the reaction takes to run to completion;\n• The temperature must be held constant — something than can pose a problem if the reaction is highly exothermic.\n\nMeasuring the concentration of a reactant or product directly — that is by chemical analysis, is awkward and seldom necessary. When it cannot be avoided, the reaction sample must usually be quenched in some way in order to stop any further change until its composition can be analyzed. This may be accomplished in various ways, depending on the particular reaction. For reactions carried out in solution, especially enzyme-catalyzed ones, it is sometimes practical to add a known quantity of acid or base to change the pH, or to add some other inhibitory agent. More commonly, however, the preferred approach is to observe some physical property whose magnitude is proportional to the extent of the reaction.\n\nClassical and laboratory-class methods\n\nThese methods are applicable to reactions that are not excessively fast, typically requiring a few minutes or hours to run to completion. They were about the only methods available before 1950. Most first-year laboratory courses students will include at least one experiment based on one of these methods.\n\nOptical methods\n\nLight absorption is perhaps the most widely-used technique. If either a reactant or a product is colored, the reaction is easily followed by recording the change in transmission of an appropriate wavelength after the reaction is started.\n\nWhen a beam o",

Identify Canada’s ecozones.\n3. Describe the differences between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems.\n\nBiomes: Global Ecosystems\n\nA biome is a geographically extensive type of ecosystem. A particular biome occurs wherever environmental conditions are suitable for its development, anywhere in the world. Biomes are characterized by the life forms of their dominant organisms, but not necessarily by their particular species. On land, biomes are generally identified by their mature or older-growth vegetation. In contrast, aquatic biomes are usually distinguished by their dominant animals. Biomes are classified using a system that is used at an international level—that is, by ecologists working in many countries.\n\nFigure 8.1 shows a map of the distribution of the most extensive terrestrial biomes. The distribution of biomes is determined by environmental conditions, which must be appropriate to support the dominant species. Moisture and temperature are usually the most important environmental influences on the distribution of terrestrial biomes (Figure 8.2). The distribution of various types of wetlands within terrestrial biomes is mostly influenced by the amount and permanence of surface water and the availability of nutrients. Marine biomes are most strongly influenced by water depth and upwellings, which affect the amounts of light and nutrients that are available to support primary productivity.\n\nAs long as environmental conditions are suitable for its development, a particular biomes may occur in widely divergent regions, even on different continents. Although widely separate regions of a biome may be dominated by different species, their life forms are typically convergent. In other words, the different species are comparable in their form and function, because the regimes of natural selection occurring in similar environments result in parallel (or convergent) evolutionary responses. Therefore, biomes are defined primarily by the structure and function of their ecosystem, but not necessarily their species composition.\n\nThis context is illustrated by the boreal forest, an extensive biome that occurs in northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Eurasia. The boreal forest occurs in regions with a cold and long winter, short but warm summer, and generally moist soil. This biome is situated between the more northern tundra, and temperate forest or prairie to the south. The dominant vegetation of boreal forest is typically coniferous trees, especially species of fir, larch, pine, or spruce. However, the particular species vary from region to region, and angiosperm (hardwood) trees may also be present.\n\nOver much of northern Canada the boreal coniferous forest is dominated by stands of black spruce (Picea mariana). However, in some regions, stands of white spruce (Picea glauca), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), balsam fi",

                "source_content": "The word circuit comes from the Latin root circ, meaning “ring” or “around”. An electrical circuit consists of at least one ring or loop through which current flows. For example, if we have a battery attached to a lamp as in Figure 3.3.1 , the current exits the battery, flows through the lamp, and then returns to the other side of the battery creating a loop or completed circuit. Without a path back to the battery, current will not flow. Thus, if we cut one of the wires connecting the battery and lamp, there is no path for current and no current flows. This is referred to as an open circuit and is a common fault that occurs when electronic systems are dropped or struck forcefully. Obviously, this will tend to render the circuit unusable. In this example, the lamp will not illuminate. The opposite of the open circuit is the short circuit. In a short circuit, an unintended alternate path for current flow exists and this also can create a malfunction. In the case of our battery and lamp, a short circuit can occur if a piece of wire or metal accidentally fell across the terminals of the lamp. The current would then have a high conductance (i.e., low resistance) path around the lamp. The vast majority of the current would take this low resistance path instead of the higher resistance path presented by the lamp. The result would be that the lamp would not light. In either the open or short case, the light does not function but there is an important difference: for the short circuit, excessive current will flow out of the battery because there is little to resist the flow of current. Thus, the battery will be drained very quickly. For the open, no current flows and thus the battery is not drained.\n\nFigure 3.3.1 : Battery and lamp circuit.\n\nFigure 3.3.2 : A generic series configuration.\n\nSeries connections are not limited to just two components. In general, a series connection is any connection of components configured such that the current through each component must be the same. This is illustrated in Figure 3.3.2 . Inside each of the lettered boxes would be a component such as a resistor or a voltage source. Note that for each component, there is one entrance point and one exit point. No matter which box you pick, the current flowing through it must be the same as the current flowing into the next box or out of the preceding box, and it doesn't matter if you follow this path in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion. Thus, this entire configuration is a series connection. The idea that current is consistent throughout should be selfevident. After all, the only way the current through, say, item B could be different from that flowing through item C or D is if some of it somehow “disappeared” along the way by magic. It is important to remember that consistent current is the hallmark feature defining a series connection:\n\n$\\text{The current is the same everywhere in a series connection.} \\label{2.1}$\n\nIt is possible that only a portion of a circuit exhi",

We will address how to create a demand curve later in this chapter, but we will begin our discussion with a brief review of microeconomic theory that endeavors to explain how consumers behave.\n• 3.2: Is the Theory of the Consumer Realistic?\nStrictly speaking, it would be difficult to make a case that the theory of the consumer conforms to our own experience of consumption decisions or what we observe of other consumers. We don’t consciously weigh the relative marginal utilities of tens of thousands of possible goods and services we might consume. We don’t know all the current prices and don’t even know of the existence of many goods and services.\n• 3.3: Determinants of Demand\nWe can approach the challenge of modeling consumer behavior in a more practical manner that is informed by the theory of the consumer. To estimate demand and study the nature of consumer demand, we start by identifying a set of key factors that have a strong influence on consumer demand.\n• 3.4: Modeling Consumer Demand\nTo develop a formal model of consumer demand, the first step is to identify the most important determinants of demand and define variables that measure those determinants. Ideally, we should use variables for which data exist so that statistical estimation techniques can be applied to develop an algebraic relationship between the units of a good consumed and the values of the key determinants.\n• 3.5: Forecasting Demand\ndentifying the key determinants of demand and developing demand functions gives a business manager a better understanding of his customers. A benefit of that understanding is an improved accuracy in forecasting the demand levels for their products and services in an upcoming period. Most businesses need to plan production activities well in advance of when the goods and services are actually provided to the consumer.\n• 3.6: Elasticity of Demand\nAn alternative approach to measuring the sensitivity of demand to its determinant factors is to assess the ratio of percentage change in demand to the percentage change in its determinant factor. This type of measurement is called an elasticity of demand.\n• 3.7: Consumption Decisions in the Short Run and the Long Run\nEconomists distinguish short-run decisions from long-run decisions. A consumer decision is considered short run when her consumption will occur soon enough to be constrained by existing household assets, personal commitments, and know-how. Given sufficient time to remove these constraints, the consumer can change her consumption patterns and make additional improvements in the utility of consumption.\n• 3.8: Price Discrimination\nIn economics, the term for charging different prices to different customers is called price discrimination.

                "source_content": "Learning Objectives\n• Explain how microbial metagenomics can give researchers a more complete picture of a particular environment\n\nPharmacogenomics, also called toxicogenomics, involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual’s genomic sequence. Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals (such as laboratory rats or mice) or live cells in the laboratory before embarking on studies with humans. Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.\n\nMicrobial Genomics: Metagenomics\n\nTraditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. In addition, the vast majority of bacterial species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment.\n\nKey Points\n\n• Pharmacogenomics involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual’s genomic sequence.\n• Genomic responses to drugs can be studied using experimental animals or live cells in the laboratory, which help indicate the potentially toxic effects of a drug.\n• Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on an individual level.\n• Metagenomics, the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche, is often a better way to study microrganisms rather than pure culture.\n\nKey Terms\n\n• pharmacogenomics: the study of genes that code for enzymes that metabolize drugs, and the design of tailor-made drugs adapted to an individual’s genetic make-up\n• metagenomics: the study of the collective genomes of multi",

There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules for the waves to move through. The speed of sound waves differs based on altitude, temperature, and medium. At sea level and a temperature of 20º C (68º F), sound waves travel in the air at about 343 meters per second.\n\nAs is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude. Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time; in sound, it is heard as pitch. High-frequency (≥15.000Hz) sounds are higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; ≤100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in cycles per second. For sound, the most-commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone’s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; dolphins, 150,000 Hz; and the American shad (Alosa sapidissima), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those frequencies above the human range are called ultrasound.\n\nAmplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume. The sound waves of louder sounds have greater amplitude than those of softer sounds. For sound, volume is measured in decibels (dB). The softest sound that a human can hear is the zero point. Humans speak normally at 60 decibels.\n\nAmplitude: For sound waves, wavelength corresponds to pitch. The amplitude of the wave corresponds to volume. The sound wave shown with a dashed line i",

Of great interest to educators are Goleman’s theories of emotional intelligence, defined as “master[y of] the emotional realm” (1995, p. xiii). In his book, Emotional Intelligence, Goleman claims lineage from Howard Gardner’s theories of multiple intelligences but faults Gardner for focusing on cognitive elements in his categories to the exclusion of feelings. Goleman describes emotional intelligence, calling it a subset of Gardner’s personal intelligences, as an individual’s awareness of her own and others’ emotions toward the ends of self-control and the management of emotional encounters with others (1995, p. xiii). To prove the importance of emotional intelligence, Goleman spends much time working through case scenarios to highlight the benefits of addressing emotional abilities in the workplace and in education. He believes emotional intelligence acts a corollary to IQ so that while the latter is seemingly out of our control, working to “master the emotional realm” (1995, p. xiii) provides “a better chance to use whatever intellectual potential the genetic lottery may have given to [us]” (1995, p. xii). Within Goleman’s economic model, focused on traditional understandings of success in work and school, emotions become a skill of the capitalist who seeks to profit as much from his financial relationships as his personal ones.\n\nWhile widely popular, Goleman’s term is too problematic for inclusion in contemplative writing pedagogy. First, although he admits that the emotional and the rational often work together in harmony, Goleman ultimately sees them as “two minds” that work as “semi-independent faculties” (1995, p. 9), which problematically gives the impression that comprehension can sometimes be devoid of emotion. This separation stands in stark contrast to a contemplative understanding of emotion as an organic form of our body’s energy so that we can no more stop feeling than cease breathing (Iyengar, 2005, p. 82). Second, Goleman’s theory tends to ignore difference and focuses more on promoting assimilation in a cookie-cutter, male-dominated world. His is a world of capitalists seeking to gain as much ground as possible, which unfortunately reduces emotional intelligence to the level of a commodity. Here, gender is ignored, often along with other factors of situatedness including class and race. Positioned within patriarchal capitalism, Goleman’s term lacks attention to difference and diversity and is fixated on singular self-control of emotions, which are in turn feminized; he thereby constructs emotional intelligence as a site of masculinized social control where the gains lie in “creating ‘smooth’ and efficient worker relations” (Boler, 1999, p. 61).\n\nIn my last chapter, I introduced emotional flexibility as a means of approaching the work of feeling in contemplative pedagogy. Here, I suggest we trade talk of emotional intelligence fo",

Investors use derivatives to hedge (decrease return volatility) or to speculate (increase the volatility of returns).\n\nAlthough often derided in the press and movies, derivatives are inherently neither good nor bad, they are merely tools used to limit losses (hedge) or to multiply gains and losses (speculate). Speculation has a bad rep but in fact it makes hedging possible because investors can hedge only if they can find a speculator willing to assume the risks that they wish to eschew.\n\nUltimately, the prices of derivatives are a function of supply and demand, both of which are subject to valuation models too mathematically complex to address here. The basic forms and functions of the four main types of derivatives—forwards, futures, options, and swaps—are easily narrated and understood, however, and form the basis of this chapter.\n\nStop and Think Box\n\nIf you could, would you receive a guaranteed grade of B for this course? Or would you rather have a chance of receiving an A even if that meant that you might fail the course?\n\nIf you take the guaranteed B, you are hedging or reducing your return (grade) variability. If you are willing to accept an A or an F, you are acting like a speculator and may end up on the dean’s list or on academic probation. Neither choice is wrong or bad but is merely a tool by which you can achieve your preferences.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n• Derivatives are instruments, the price of which derives from the price or performance of some underlying asset.\n• Derivatives can be used to hedge (reduce risk) or to speculate (increase risk).\n• Derivatives are just tools that investors can use to increase or decrease return volatility and hence are not inherently bad. Speculation is the obverse of hedging, which would be impossible to do without speculators serving as counterparties.\n\n12.02: Forwards and Futures\n\nLearning Objectives\n• What is a forward contract and what is it used for?\n• What is a futures contract and what is its economic purpose?\n\nImagine you want to throw a party at the end of the semester and have a budget of \\$100 for beer.

Many chemical reactions take place in labs. However, most chemical reactions do not. Where do they occur? They happen in the world all around you. They even happen inside your own body. In fact, you are alive only because of the many chemical reactions that constantly take place inside your cells.\n\nWhat Is a Chemical Reaction?\n\nchemical reaction is a process in which some substances change into different substances. Substances that start a chemical reaction are called reactants. Substances that are produced in the reaction are called products. Reactants and products can be elements or compounds. Chemical reactions are represented by chemical equations, like the one below, in which reactants (on the left) are connected by an arrow to products (on the right).\n\nReactants → Products\n\nChemical reactions may occur quickly or slowly. Look at the two pictures in the figure below. Both represent chemical reactions. In the picture on the left, a reaction inside a fire extinguisher causes foam to shoot out of the extinguisher. This reaction occurs almost instantly. In the picture on the right, a reaction causes the iron tool to turn to rust. This reaction occurs very slowly. In fact, it might take many years for all of the iron in the tool to turn to rust.\n\nQ: What happens during a chemical reaction? Where do the reactants go, and where do the products come from?\n\nA: During a chemical reaction, chemical changes take place. Some chemical bonds break and new chemical bonds form.\n\nSame Atoms, New Bonds\n\nThe reactants and products in a chemical reaction contain the same atoms, but they are rearranged during the reaction. As a result, the atoms are in different combinations in the products than they were in the reactants. This happens because chemical bonds break in the reactants and new chemical bonds form in the products.\n\nConsider the chemical reaction in which water forms from oxygen and hydrogen gases. The figure below represents this reaction. Bonds break in molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, and then new bonds form in molecules of water. In both reactants and products there are four hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms, but the atoms are combined differently in water.\n\nTypes of Chemical Reactions\n\nThe chemical reaction in the figure above, in which water forms from hydrogen and oxygen, is an example of a synthesis reaction. In this type of reaction, two or more reactants combine to synthesize a single product. There are several other types of chemical reactions, including decomposition, replacement, and combustion reactions. The table below compares these four types of chemical reactions.\n\nFour Types of Chemical Reactions\nType of Reaction General Equation Example\nSynthesis A+B → C 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl\nDecomposition AB → A + B 2H2O →2H2 + O2\nSingle Replacement A+BC → B+ AC 2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2\nDouble Replacement AB+ CDAD + CB NaCl+ AgF ",

Morphological equilibrium is dependent on external conditions, but if we assume these to be neutral, different basin geometries may fulfil the condition for equilibrium:\n\n• Shallow channels and large intertidal (storage) flat area (e.g. Wadden Sea);\n• Deep channels and small intertidal (storage) flat area (e.g. Oosterschelde);\n• Intermediate geometries.\n\nFigure 9.34: Relation between basin-averaged channel depth and flat area for Dutch tidal basins (after Dronkers, 2005). The ratio of water depths at HW and LW (\\(y\\)-axis) gets larger for shallower channels. The wet surface area ratio on the 𝑥-axis increases for larger intertidal storage areas.\n\nIn the equilibrium condition, the geometrical characteristics of the basin are such that the durations of ebb and flood are approximately equal. (Dronkers, 1998) derived an expression for this equilibrium condition based on the assumption that the tidal asymmetry at sea is not strong. This condition is shown in Fig. 9.34. It indicates that for Dutch tidal basins the ratio between the average channel depths and flat surface area is such that net ebb and flood transports are approximately equal, but have a slight flood-dominant tendency.\n\nThe tidal basins in the Wadden Sea (especially in the eastern Wadden Sea) are generally considered to be in morphological equilibrium. The flood-dominance found in Fig. 9.34 could be the result of the neglect of residual currents in the derivation. As a result of Stokes’ drift a compensating Eulerian current will enhance the ebb flow (see Sect. 5.7.6). It could also be that the flood-dominance is the result of a sediment demand of the basin as a result of sea-level rise (Sect. 9.8.3).\n\nWhat happens if we disturb this equilibrium slightly? An increase of the channel depth will enhance the ebb-dominance and cause a net sediment export. The result is a further deepening of the channels; this is a case of an unstable morphological equilibrium (Sect. 1.5.2). An increase of the channel width is equivalent to a relative decrease of the intertidal areas. In this case a net sediment import occurs, annihilating the initial disturbance (stable equilibrium, see Sect. 1.5.2).\n\nSome tidal basins",

If history were written emphasizing the most demographically important groups, then, until the discovery of gold, California’s history would be primarily that of its native peoples, with small attention given to the Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo immigrants. But history reflects political and cultural power and is usually written by the conquerors.\n\nSpanish, Mexican, and early Anglo American settlers in California were almost uniformly critical of the native peoples. The Spanish had mixed views about the Indians, whom they considered “child-like,” “indolent,” and given to indulge in “brutal appetites,” while paradoxically seeing them as innocent and naturally God’s children. Some Mexican settlers, or pobladores, viewed the native peoples either as dangerous threats to civilization or as lazy peones who needed strong guidance. The Anglos called the California Indians “digger Indians,” classifying them as the most primitive of all North American Indian peoples for lack of such rudimentary accomplishments of civilization as farming and pottery. Such negative valuation allowed Euro-Americans to justify taking Indian lands and destroying their societies.\n\nHerbert Howe Bancroft, a famous and influential 19th-century California historian, believed that the California Indians were culturally inferior to the whites. Many modern misconceptions about the level of culture attained by the California Indians can be traced to 19th-century positivist scholars, notably Lewis Henry Morgan, one of those who conceived of all human cultural evolution as progressing through stages of savagery, barbarism, and finally civilization. These scholars tended to equate “civilization” with the development of agriculture and technology and relegated food-gathering societies to the level of barbarism, not taking into account that human intelligence is also reflected in successful adaptation to an environment. Such beliefs persisted into the 1960s and even later, with historians and anthropologists usually characterizing the California native cultures as “primitive” and “underdeveloped,” thus reflecting prejudices that are the product of ignorance as well as ethnocentrism born out of racialist ideologies of the past.\n\nThese attitudes make it hard to remember that much of the drama of those years of conquest was played out against a backdrop of the extensive, rich, and diverse native culture that existed across the North American continent. The many groups in California were descendants of natives who had migrated from the east and north, and as such they shared cultural patterns with the larger Indian society. Along with other Indian peoples in North America in 1492, the California Indians developed a culture that fit their natural environment. Few natives in what later became the ",

Then we used algebra to find the equation that fit the points exactly. In this section, we use a modeling technique called regression analysis to find a curve that models data collected from real-world observations. With regression analysis, we don’t expect all the points to lie perfectly on the curve. The idea is to find a model that best fits the data. Then we use the model to make predictions about future events.\n\nDo not be confused by the word model. In mathematics, we often use the terms function, equation, and model interchangeably, even though they each have their own formal definition. The term model is typically used to indicate that the equation or function approximates a real-world situation.\n\nWe will concentrate on three types of regression models in this section: exponential, logarithmic, and logistic. Having already worked with each of these functions gives us an advantage. Knowing their formal definitions, the behavior of their graphs, and some of their real-world applications gives us the opportunity to deepen our understanding. As each regression model is presented, key features and definitions of its associated function are included for review. Take a moment to rethink each of these functions, reflect on the work we’ve done so far, and then explore the ways regression is used to model real-world phenomena.\n\nBuilding an Exponential Model from Data\n\nAs we’ve learned, there are a multitude of situations that can be modeled by exponential functions, such as investment growth, radioactive decay, atmospheric pressure changes, and temperatures of a cooling object. What do these phenomena have in common? For one thing, all the models either increase or decrease as time moves forward. But that’s not the whole story. It’s the way data increase or decrease that helps us determine whether it is best modeled by an exponential equation. Knowing the behavior of exponential functions in general allows us to recognize when to use exponential regression, so let’s review exponential growth and decay.\n\nRecall that exponential functions have the form $y=ab^x$ or $y=A_0e^{kx}$. When performing regression analysis, we use the form most commonly used on graphing utilities, $y=ab^x$. Take a moment to reflect on the characteristics we’ve already learned about the exponential function $y=ab^x$ (assume $a>0$):\n\n• $b$ must be greater than zero and not equal to one.\n• The initial value of the model is $y=a$.\n• If $b>1$, the function models exponential growth. As $x$ increases, the outputs of the model increase slowly at first, but then increase more and more rapidly, without bound.\n• If $0<b<1$, the function models exponential decay. As $x$ increases",

The frequency and intensity of disturbances such as fire, insect attacks, or windstorms profoundly influence tree growth over time.\n• 4.5: Increment Boring\nCounting a tree’s annual rings is a reliable way to estimate its age when records are unavailable; this method has been adapted for living trees. An instrument called an increment borer extracts a small, pencil-sized piece of wood, or core sample, from the trunk of the tree. A mini-auger is drilled by hand from the bark to the center (pith) of the tree, and the resulting core sample extracted from the hole displays the annual rings (or increments of growth) of the tree at that point in the tree.\n• 4.6:. Field Techniques for Increment Boring\n• 4.7: Summary Questions \n\n04: Tree Age \n\n4.1 Determining Tree Age\n\nHow old is that tree? Trees, particularly big trees, fascinate us, and we often want to know how long a tree has been alive. Was it here when Lewis and Clark reached the Pacific Ocean in 1805, or when Oregon became a state in 1859? Did it survive the Columbus Day storm of 1962? Did it germinate and begin its life as a result of the Tillamook Burns or the 1996 floods in the Willamette Valley?\n\nAlthough we love to ask the question, it is usually nearly impossible to guess the right answer. Tree size, particularly for big trees, is as much a reflection of tree species and growing conditions as it is tree age. Consider a California redwood (Sequoiadendron sempervirens). This fast-growing species could easily reach 40 feet in ten years. On the other hand, it may take a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) twice as many years to reach the same height even if the two species were growing side by side (Burns and Honkala 1990). Nearly any species growing in the sun will grow significantly faster than in heavy shade (Figure 4.1). Grand fir (Abies grandis) or Douglas-fir growing in the moist, moderate climate of western Oregon will grow taller faster than the same species in the drier and colder climate east of the Cascade Mts. Knowledge of species, habitat, and available tools and techniques all help in estimating tree age.\n\nFigure 4.1. Douglas-fir seedlings growing in the sun (left) and shade (right). Note the bushier appearance and greater number of needles on the tree in the sun.\n\n04.2: Young trees\n\nAn approximate age for many young conifers can be determined by “counting the whorls.” Some trees, including most conifers growing in the Pacific Northwest, have determinate height growth. This means that they put on one “flush of ",

                "source_content": "There are six problem solving approaches and interventions most commonly used among practitioners. Each approach examines a different aspect of a social problem. The nature of the problem and people involved determines the most appropriate intervention to apply.\n\nA social systems approach examines the social structure surrounding the problem or issue. This approach requires macro, meso, and micro levels of analysis (see pages 12-13) to help understand the structure of the problem and the arrangement of individuals and social groups involved. Analysis requires comprehension of the entire issue and parts associated, as well as, which components and protocols of the structure are independent or dependent of each other. Application of this approach requires grasp of the complete problem including the hierarchy, order, patterns, and boundaries of individuals and social groups including their interactions, relationships, and processes as a body or structure surrounding the issue (Bruhn and Rebach 2007).\n\nThe interventions deployed using a social systems approach focus on establishing and maintaining stability for all parties even while change is occurring. Social system interventions require change agents or leaders such as sociological practitioners to help control and guide inputs (what is put in or taken into the problem) and outputs (what is produced, delivered, or supplied resulting from change) used in problem solving (Bruhn and Rebach 2007). This approach requires the involvement of everyone in the social structure to design or re-design the system and processes around the issue.\n\nThe human ecology approach examines the “web of life” or the ecosystem of a social problem or issue. This approach is often visually represented by a spider web to demonstrate how lives are interlinked and interdependent. A human ecology approach focuses on macro and meso levels of analysis to develop knowledge about the social bonds, personal needs, and environmental conditions that impede or support life challenges and opportunities for individuals. Practitioners evaluate and analyze where individuals and groups fit in the social structure or ecosystem and their roles. The purpose of this approach is to identify cognitive and emotional boundaries people experience living in social systems to help confront and remove the obstacles they face.\n\nInterventions applied in a human ecological approach target changes in families, institutions, and small communities. The goal is to confront the stressors and strain created by social situations and settings. Interventions from a human ecology approach help people determine acceptable behaviors within different social environments (Bruhn and Rebach 2007). Practitioners work with social groups to remove collaborative challenges between groups in a social ecosystem and the individuals working and living within them. Change is concentrated on developing a new system and process to support and remove obstacles for individuals effect",

Joints are responsible for movement, such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.\n\nClassification of Joints on the Basis of Structure\n\nThere are two ways to classify joints: on the basis of their structure or on the basis of their function. The structural classification divides joints into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint.\n\nFibrous Joints\n\nThe bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones and so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. There are three types of fibrous joints: sutures, syndesmoses, and gomphoses. Sutures are found only in the skull and possess short fibers of connective tissue that hold the skull bones tightly in place (Figure 38.23).\n\nFigure 38.23 Sutures are fibrous joints found only in the skull.\n\nSyndesmoses are joints in which the bones are connected by a band of connective tissue, allowing for more movement than in a suture. An example of a syndesmosis is the joint of the tibia and fibula in the ankle. The amount of movement in these types of joints is determined by the length of the connective tissue fibers. Gomphoses occur between teeth and their sockets; the term refers to the way the tooth fits into the socket like a peg (Figure 38.24). The tooth is connected to the socket by a connective tissue referred to as the periodontal ligament.\n\nFigure 38.24 Gomphoses are fibrous joints between the teeth and their sockets. (credit: modification of work by Gray's Anatomy)\n\nCartilaginous Joints\n\nCartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. There are two types of cartilaginous joints: synchondroses and symphyses. In a synchondrosis, the bones are joined by hyaline cartilage. Synchondroses are found in the epiphyseal plates of growing bones in children. In symphyses, hyaline cartilage covers the end of the bone but the connection between bones occurs through fibrocartilage. Symphyses are found at the joints between vertebrae. Either type of cartilaginous joint allows for very little movement.\n\nSynovial Joints\n\nSynovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (Figure 38.25). This space is referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire joint is surrounded by an articular",

The Debye–Hückel approximation holds for small electrostatic potential or high temperature conditions such that\n\n$\\dfrac{ze\\Phi}{k_B T} \\ll 1 \\nonumber$\n\nThis is the regime in which the entropy of mixing dominates the electrostatic interactions between ions. In this limit, we can expand the exponential in eq. (6.5.5) as $\\exp [-ze \\Phi /k_B T] \\approx 1 - ze \\Phi /k_B T$. The leading term in the resulting sum drops because of the charge neutrality condition, eq. (6.5.4). Keeping the second term in the expansion leads to\n\n$\\nabla^2 \\Phi = \\kappa^2 \\Phi \\label{eq6.6.1}$\n\nwhere\n\n$\\kappa^2 = \\dfrac{2e^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T} I \\nonumber$\n\nand the ionic strength, $I$, is defined as\n\n$I = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sum_i C_{0, i} z_i^2 \\nonumber$\n\nLooking at eq. ($\\ref{eq6.6.1}$), we see that the Debye–Hückel approximation linearizes the PBE. It is known as the Debye–Hückel equation, or the linearized PBE. For the case of the 1:1 electrolyte solution described by eq. , we again obtain eq. ($\\ref{eq6.6.1}$) using $\\text{sinh} (x) \\approx x$ as $x \\to \\infty$, with\n\n$\\kappa^2 = \\dfrac{2z^2 e^2 C_0}{\\varepsilon k_B T} = 8\\pi z^2 C_0 \\ell_B \\nonumber$\n\nThe constant $\\kappa$ has units of inverse distance, and it’s inverse is known as the Debye length $\\lambda_D = \\kappa^{-1}$. The Debye length sets the distance scale over which the electrostatic potential decays, i.e., the distance over which charges are screened from one another. For the symmetric electrolytes\n\n$\\lambda_D = \\kappa^{-1} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\varepsilon k_B T}{2z^2 e^2 C_0}}$\n\nAs an example: 1:1 electrolytes in $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$: $\\varepsilon = 80$; $z_+ = -z_- = 1$; $T = 300\\ K$ leads to\n\n$\\begin{array} {ll} {C_0 = 100\\ mM} & {\\lambda_D = 9.6\\ \\mathring{A}} \\ {C_0 = 10\\ mM} & {\\lambda_D = 30.4\\ \\mathring{A}} \\end{array} \\nonumber$\n\n$\\lambda_D (\\mathring{A}) \\approx 3.04 \\cdot [C_0 (M)]^{-1/2} \\nonumber$\n\nThe Debye approximation holds for small electrostatic potentials relative to $k_B T (r > \\lambda_D)$. For instance, it’s ok for ion distribution about large protein or vesicle but not for water in a binding pocket.\n\nThe variation of Debye length with concentrations of electrolytes.

                "source_content": "A scan of Figure 2.1 shows that the ice cream bar venture could result in an economic profit or loss depending on the volume of business. As the sales volume increases, revenue and cost increase and profit becomes progressively less negative, turns positive, and then becomes increasingly positive. There is a zone of lower volume levels where economic costs exceed revenues and a zone on the higher volume levels where revenues exceed economic costs.\n\nOne important consideration for our three students is whether they are confident that the sales volume will be high enough to fall in the range of positive economic profits. The volume level that separates the range with economic loss from the range with economic profit is called the breakeven point. From the graph we can see the breakeven point is slightly less than 35,000 units. If the students can sell above that level, which the prior operator did, it will be worthwhile to proceed with the venture. If they are doubtful of reaching that level, they should abandon the venture now, even if that means losing their nonrefundable deposit.\n\nThere are a number of ways to determine a precise value for the breakeven level algebraically. One is to solve for the value of Q that makes the economic profit function equal to zero:\n\n$0 = 1.2 Q − 40,000$\n\nor\n\n$Q = \\dfrac{40,000}{1.2} = 33,334\\, \\text{units}.$\n\nAn equivalent approach is to find the value of Q where the revenue function and cost function have identical values.\n\nAnother way to assess the breakeven point is to find how large the volume must be before the average cost drops to the price level. In this case, we need to find the value of Q where AC is equal to $1.50. This occurs at the breakeven level calculated earlier. A fourth approach to solving for the breakeven level is to consider how profit changes as the volume level increases. Each additional item sold incurs a variable cost per unit of$0.30 and is sold for a price of $1.50. The difference, called the unit contribution margin, would be$1.20. For each additional unit of volume, the profit increases by $1.20. In order to make an overall economic profit, the business would need to accrue a sufficient number of unit contribution margins to cover the economic fixed cost of$40,000. So the breakeven level would be\n\n$Q = \\dfrac{\\text{fixed cost}}{\\text{price per unit} − \\text{variable cost per unit}} = \\dfrac{40,000}{1.50 − 0.30} = 33,333.3$\n\nor $33,334\\,\\text{units}$.\n\nOnce the operating volume crosses the breakeven threshold, each additional unit contribution margin results in additional profit.\n\nWe get an interesting insight into the nature of a business by comparing the unit contribution margin with the price. In the case of the ice cream business, the unit contribution margin is 80% of the price. When the price and unit contribution margins are close, most of the revenue generated from additional sales turns into profit once you get above the breakeven level.

Their Grandpa Max used to create all different kinds of ice cream for Grandma Mina and the boys to try. Grandpa was an organic chemist and loved to create some interesting flavors. Years later, after Grandpa Max passed away, Bruce was cleaning out his grandpa’s house and discovered his secret book of recipes.\n\nAnd so it began.\n\nIn the 1980s, Bruce started on his journey and traveled throughout Europe and the United States doing gourmet ice cream research. With all the new information gathered and the treasure trove of Grandpa Max’s secret recipes, Bruce and Mark opened Max and Mina’s Ice Cream in 1997 in a shopping center next to Shimon’s Pizza Falafel Dairy Restaurant in Flushing, Queens, New York. They test marketed their recipes directly to the public. The public loved it—and so did the local restaurants and party planners.\n\nMax and Mina’s Ice Cream revolutionized America’s favorite dessert with daring ingredients and bold innovation. Their unique ability to intrigue and challenge old notions of mundane flavors draws unbelievable attention at home in New York and around the globe. The most distant customer of note was from Australia, someone who insisted on going to Max and Mina’s right off the plane at Kennedy Airport.\n\nThe Beckers make their ice cream products with at least 16 percent butterfat, putting them into the gourmet category. All their ice creams are kosher, but some products adhere to even stricter dairy guidelines. The shop itself features an array of posters, a display of Wacky Packages bubblegum stickers, candy wrappers, a Jerry Garcia etching, and old-fashioned signs.\n\nA visit to Max and Mina’s will be an unusual ice cream experience. If you dare to take the plunge, why not try unforgettable flavors like beer, lox, babka, corn-on-the-cob, ketchup, garlic, or merlot—just to mention a few? There are also many of the more traditional flavors that you know and love. There is a rotating menu of one thousand flavors, but only about forty ice cream flavors and eight to ten sorbets are available at any one time. Bruce and Mark constantly encourage their patrons to be vocal in brainstorming new flavors, especially flavors that compliment events. Turkey ice cream, anyone? Have an idea?

This is called a one-to-one mapping from points in the plane to ordered pairs. The polar coordinate system provides an alternative method of mapping points to ordered pairs. In this section we see that in some circumstances, polar coordinates can be more useful than rectangular coordinates.\n\nDefining Polar Coordinates\n\nTo find the coordinates of a point in the polar coordinate system, consider Figure $1$. The point $P$ has Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$. The line segment connecting the origin to the point $P$ measures the distance from the origin to $P$ and has length $r$. The angle between the positive x-axis and the line segment has measure $θ$. This observation suggests a natural correspondence between the coordinate pair $(x,y)$ and the values $r$ and $θ$. This correspondence is the basis of the polar coordinate system. Note that every point in the Cartesian plane has two values (hence the term ordered pair) associated with it. In the polar coordinate system, each point also has two values associated with it: $r$ and $θ$.\n\nUsing right-triangle trigonometry, the following equations are true for the point $P$:\n\n$\\cos θ=\\dfrac{x}{r}\\text{ so }x=r\\cos θ \\nonumber$\n\n$\\sin θ=\\dfrac{y}{r}\\text{ so }y=r\\sin θ. \\nonumber$\n\nFurthermore,\n\n$r^2=x^2+y^2 \\nonumber$\n\nand\n\n$\\tan θ=\\dfrac{y}{x}. \\nonumber$\n\nEach point $(x,y)$ in the Cartesian coordinate system can therefore be represented as an ordered pair $(r,θ)$ in the polar coordinate system. The first coordinate is called the radial coordinate and the second coordinate is called the angular coordinate. Every point in the plane can be represented in this form.\n\nNote that the equation $\\tan θ=y/x$ has an infinite number of solutions for any ordered pair $(x,y)$. However, if we restrict the solutions to values between $0$ and $2π$ then we can assign a unique solution to the quadrant in which the original point $(x,y)$ is located. Then the corresponding value of $r$ is positive, so $r^2=x^2+y^2$.\n\nConverting Points between Coordinate Systems\n\nGiven a point $P$ in the plane with Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ and polar coordinates $(r,θ)$, the following conversion formulas hold true:\n\n\\begin{align} x &=r\\cos θ \\label{eq1} \\[4pt] y &=r\\sin θ \\label{eq2}\\end{align}\n\nand\n\n\\begin{align} r^2 &= x^2+y^2 \\label{eq3}\\[4pt] \\tan θ &=\\dfrac{y}{x} \\label{eq4}\\end{align}.\n\nThese formulas can be used to convert from rectangular to polar or from polar to rectangular coordinates. Notice that Equation \\ref{eq3} is the Pythagorean theorem. (Figure $1$).\n\nExample $1$: Converting between Rectangular and Pola",

Similar to detective work, scientists must use evidence to uncover the facts. In the case of phylogenies, evolutionary investigations focus on two types of evidence: morphologic (form and function) and genetic.\n\nTwo Options for Similarities\n\nIn general, organisms that share similar physical features and genomes tend to be more closely related than those that do not. Such features that overlap both morphologically (in form) and genetically are referred to as homologous structures and stem from developmental similarities that are based on evolution. For example, the bones in the wings of bats and birds have homologous structures (Figure \\(1\\)), as do the leaves of monocots and eudicots (Figure \\(2\\)).\n\nNotice it is not simply a single bone, but rather a grouping of several bones arranged in a similar way. The more complex the feature, the more likely any kind of overlap is due to a common evolutionary past. Imagine two people from different countries both inventing a car with all the same parts and in exactly the same arrangement without any previous or shared knowledge. That outcome would be highly improbable. However, if two people both invented a hammer, it would be reasonable to conclude that both could have the original idea without the help of the other. The same relationship between complexity and shared evolutionary history is true for homologous structures in organisms.\n\nIn plants, we see similar trends. An example of a homologous structure in plants is the leaf. Groups of vascular plants have evolved from a shared common ancestor that formed leaves. In particular, we could look at leaves formed by flowering plants (Angiosperms), the most recent major clade within kingdom Plantae. The developmental pathway and internal anatomy of these leaves have similarities due to shared ancestry, though they may appear outwardly different.\n\nMisleading Appearances\n\nSome organisms may be very closely related, even though a minor genetic change caused a major morphological difference to make them look quite different. Similarly, unrelated organisms may be distantly related, but appear very much alike. This usually happens because both organisms were in common adaptations that evolved within similar environmental conditions. When similar characteristics occur because of environmental constraints and not due to a close evolutionary relationship, it is called an analogy or homoplasy. For example, insects use wings to fly like bats and birds, but the wing structure and embryonic origin is completely different. These are called analogous structures (Figure \\(3\\) and Figure \\(4\\)).\n\nSimilar traits can be either homologous or analogous. Homologous traits are shared due to common ancestry; analogous traits hav",

                "source_content": "The reaction discussed in the previous section involves an addition to an achiral reactant and forms an optically inactive, racemic mixture of two enantiomeric products. What would happen, though, if we were to carry out the reaction on a single enantiomer of a chiral reactant? For example, what stereochemical result would be obtained from addition of H2O to a chiral alkene, such as (R)-4-methyl-1-hexene? The product of the reaction, 4-methyl-2-hexanol, has two chirality centers and so has four possible stereoisomers.\n\nLet’s think about the two chirality centers separately. What about the configuration at C4, the methyl-bearing carbon atom? Since C4 has the R configuration in the starting material and this chirality center is unaffected by the reaction, its configuration is unchanged. Thus, the configuration at C4 in the product remains R (assuming that the relative rankings of the four attached groups are not changed by the reaction).\n\nWhat about the configuration at C2, the newly formed chirality center? As shown in Figure 8.14, the stereochemistry at C2 is established by reaction of H2O with a carbocation intermediate in the usual manner. But this carbocation doesn’t have a plane of symmetry; it is chiral because of the chirality center at C4. Because the carbocation is chiral and has no plane of symmetry, it doesn’t react equally well from the top and bottom faces. One of the two faces is likely, for steric reasons, to be a bit more accessible than the other, leading to a mixture of R and S products in some ratio other than 50 : 50. Thus, two diastereomeric products, (2R,4R)-4-methyl-2-hexanol and (2S,4R)-4-methyl-2-hexanol, are formed in unequal amounts, and the mixture is optically active.\n\nAs a general rule, the formation of a new chirality center by a chiral reactant leads to unequal amounts of diastereomeric products. If the chiral reactant is optically active because only one enantiomer is used rather than a racemic mixture, then the products are also optically active.\n\nProblem 8-20\nWhat products are formed from acid-catalyzed hydration of racemic (±)-4-methyl-1-hexene? What can you say about the relative amounts of the products? Is the product mixture optically active?\nProblem 8-21\nWhat products are formed from hydration of 4-methylcyclopentene?

This is simply because they are algebraic equations, and any nth order algebraic equation will always yield “n” roots. However, those “n” roots are not required to be distinct, and that is not all: they are not required be real numbers, either.\n• 10.2: Modern Cubic EOS\nFirst, we can say that the vdW cubic behavior is qualitatively reasonable; and second, we can say that it is capable of describing the continuity between liquid and vapor. Nevertheless, vdW cubic EOS has been proven not to bequantitatively suitable for most engineering purposes. Certainly, it yields unacceptable errors for the quantitative prediction of densities and any other related thermodynamic property.\n• 10.3: Redlich-Kwong EOS (1949)\nRedlich and Kwong revised the van der Waals EOS by making the attraction parameter “a” of van der Waals a function of temperature.\n• 10.4: Soave-Redlich-Kwong EOS (1972)\nIn 1972, Soave proposed an important modification to the RK EOS — or shall we say, a modification to vdW EOS. Between the time of vdW EOS and Redlich-Kwong’s, a new concept for fluid characterization was being discussed. Pitzer had introduced the concept of acentric factor in 1955.\n• 10.5: Action Item \n\n10: Cubic EOS and Their Behavior II \n\nIt comes as no surprise that cubic equations of state yield three different roots for volume and compressibility factor.

However, those “n” roots are not required to be distinct, and that is not all: they are not required be real numbers, either. A quadratic expression (n = 2) may have zero real roots (e.g., $x^2 + 1 = 0$); this is because those roots are complex numbers. In the case of cubic expressions (n = 3), we will either have one or three real roots; this is because complex roots always show up in pairs (i.e., once you have a complex root, its conjugate must also be a solution.) In our case, and because we are dealing with physical quantities (densities, volumes, compressibility factors), only real roots are of interest. More specifically, we look for real, positive roots such that $\\bar{V} > b$ in the case of molar volume and $Z > Pb/RT} in the case of compressibility factor. In a cubic equation of state, the possibility of three real roots is restricted to the case of sub-critical conditions (\\(T < T_c$), because the S-shaped behavior, which represents the vapor-liquid transition, takes place only at temperatures below critical.

Define adjectives and how they are used.\n\nIf your first language is not English, you will most likely need some extra help when writing in Standard, or formal, English. New students of Standard English often make similar kinds of errors. Even if you have been speaking English for a long time, you may not feel as confident in your written English skills. This chapter covers the most common errors made by English language learners and helps you avoid similar mistakes in your writing.\n\nBasic Sentence Structures\n\nThe most basic sentence structure in English is a subject plus a verb. A subject performs the action in the sentence, and the verb identifies the action. Keep in mind that in some languages, such as Spanish and Italian, an obvious subject does not always perform the action in a sentence; the subject is often implied by the verb. However, every sentence in English must have a subject and a verb to express a complete thought.\n\nNot all sentences are as simple as a subject plus a verb. To form more complex sentences, writers build upon this basic structure. Adding a prepositional phrase to the basic sentence creates a more complex sentence. A preposition is a part of speech that relates a noun or a pronoun to another word in a sentence. It also introduces a prepositional phrase. If you can identify a preposition, you will be able to identify a prepositional phrase.\n\nOn is the preposition. On the couch is the prepositional phrase.\n\nCommon Prepositions\nabout beside off\nabove between on\nacross by over\nafter during through\nagainst except to\nalong for toward\namong from under\naround in until\nat into up\nbefore like with\nbehind of without\n\nExercise \\(1\\)\n\nCopy the following sentences onto your own sheet of paper and underline the prepositional phrases.\n\n1.

Maria celebrated her birthday in January.\n\nAnother sentence structure that is important to understand is subject + verb + object. There are two types of objects: direct objects and indirect objects.\n\nA direct object receives the action of the verb.\n\nThe letter directly receives the action of the verb writes.\n\nTip\n\nA quick way to find the direct object is to ask what? or who?\n\nSentence: Maurice kicked the ball.\n\nWhat did Maurice kick? The direct object, ball.\n\nSentence: Maurice kicked Tom by accident.\n\nWho did Maurice kick? The direct object, Tom.\n\nAn indirect object does not receive the action of the verb.\n\nThe action (writes) is performed for or to the indirect object (me).\n\nTip\n\nEven though the indirect object is not found after a preposition in English, it can be discovered by asking to whom? or for whom? after the verb.\n\nSentence: Dad baked the children some cookies.\n\nFor whom did Dad bake the cookies?

We focus on the networks of the neocortex (\"new cortex\", often just referred to as \"cortex\"), which is the evolutionarily most recent, outer portion of the brain where most of advanced cognitive functions take place. There are three major categories of emergent network phenomena:\n\n• Categorization of diverse patterns of activity into relevant groups: For example, faces can look very different from one another in terms of their raw \"pixel\" inputs, but we can categorize these diverse inputs in many different ways, to treat some patterns as more similar than others: male vs. female, young vs. old, happy vs. sad, \"my mother\" vs. \"someone other\", etc. Forming these categories is essential for enabling us to make the appropriate behavioral and cognitive responses (approach vs. avoid, borrow money from, etc.). Imagine trying to relate all the raw inputs of a visual image of a face to appropriate behavioral responses, without the benefit of such categories. The relationship (\"mapping\") between pixels and responses is just too complex. These intermediate, abstract categories organize and simplify cognition, just like file folders organize and simplify documents on your computer. One can argue that much of intelligence amounts to developing and using these abstract categories in the right ways. Biologically, we'll see how successive layers of neural detectors, organized into a hierarchy, enable this kind of increasingly abstract categorization of the world. We will also see that many individual neural detectors at each stage of processing can work together to capture the subtlety and complexity necessary to encode complex conceptual categories, in the form of a distributed representation. These distributed representations are also critical for enabling multiple different ways of categorizing an input to be active at the same time -- e.g., a given face can be simultaneously recognized as female, old, and happy. A great deal of the emergent intelligence of the human brain arises from multiple successive levels of cascading distributed representations, constituting the collective actions of billions of excitatory pyramidal neurons working together in the cortex.\n• Bidirectional excitatory dynamics are produced by the pervasive bidirectional (e.g., bottom-up and top-down or feedforward and feedback) connectivity in the neocortex. The ability of information to flow in all directions throughout the brain is critical for understanding phenomena like our ability to focus on the task at hand and not get distracted by irrelevant incoming stimuli (did my email inbox just beep??), and our ability to resolve ambiguity in inputs by bringing higher-level knowledge to bear on lower-level processing stages.

Innate immunity occurs naturally because of genetic factors or physiology; it is not induced by infection or vaccination but works to reduce the workload for the adaptive immune response. Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication. The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential response to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors.\n\nPhysical and Chemical Barriers\n\nBefore any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skin’s acidity. In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infection. Regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the stomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).\n\nDespite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins.\n\nPathogen Recognition\n\nAn infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. The innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells t",

Perhaps the most significant prediction of Maxwell’s equations is the existence of combined electric and magnetic (or electromagnetic) fields that propagate through space as electromagnetic waves. Because Maxwell’s equations hold in free space, the predicted electromagnetic waves, unlike mechanical waves, do not require a medium for their propagation.\n\nA general treatment of the physics of electromagnetic waves is beyond the scope of this textbook. We can, however, investigate the special case of an electromagnetic wave that propagates through free space along the x-axis of a given coordinate system.\n\nElectromagnetic Waves in One Direction\n\nAn electromagnetic wave consists of an electric field, defined as usual in terms of the force per charge on a stationary charge, and a magnetic field, defined in terms of the force per charge on a moving charge. The electromagnetic field is assumed to be a function of only the x-coordinate and time. The y-component of the electric field is then written as $E_y (x,t)$, the z-component of the magnetic field as $B_z (x,t)$, etc. Because we are assuming free space, there are no free charges or currents, so we can set $Q_{in} = 0$ and $I = 0$ in Maxwell’s equations.\n\nThe transverse nature of electromagnetic waves\n\nWe examine first what Gauss’s law for electric fields implies about the relative directions of the electric field and the propagation direction in an electromagnetic wave. Assume the Gaussian surface to be the surface of a rectangular box whose cross-section is a square of side l and whose third side has length $\\Delta x$, as shown in Figure $1$. Because the electric field is a function only of x and t, the y-component of the electric field is the same on both the top (labeled Side 2) and bottom (labeled Side 1) of the box, so that these two contributions to the flux cancel. The corresponding argument also holds for the net flux from the z-component of the electric field through Sides 3 and 4. Any net flux through the surface therefore comes entirely from the x-component of the electric field. Because the electric field has no y- or z-dependence, $E_x(x,t)$ is constant over the face of the box with area A and has a possibly different value $E_x (x + \\Delta x, t)$ that is constant over the opposite face of the box.\n\nApplying Gauss’s law gives\n\n$\\text{Net flux} = - E_x (x,t) A + E_x (x + \\D",

                "source_content": "A financial ratio or accounting ratio is a relative magnitude of two selected numerical values taken from an enterprise's financial statements. Often used in accounting, there are many standard ratios used to try to evaluate the overall financial condition of a corporation or other organization. Financial ratios are useful to managers within a firm, to current and potential shareholders (owners) of a firm, and to a firm's creditors. Financial analysts use financial ratios to compare the strengths and weaknesses in various companies. If shares in a company trade in a financial market, the market price of the shares is useful in certain financial ratios.\n\nRatios are useful to examine and display the ‘liquidity’ or amount of cash, accounts receivable, or other forms of assets that can be converted to cash quickly if the need arises. In the restaurant industry, how quickly or slowly the perishable food, paper, and other items we stock is used are replenished is always of major concern to the operation. The ‘turnover’ rate calculation occurring weekly, monthly, or quarterly, is indicative of how well we are projecting the restaurant’s product demand, and how well we are controlling storage costs and physical space allocations. Solvency ratios examine the status assets and liabilities, and profitability ratios give us a way to discuss and display how well the operation is conducting business. The basic ‘four’ different classes of ratios we will discuss are:\n\n1. Liquidity\n2. Turnover\n3. Solvency\n4. Profitability\n\nWe should first define the term ‘ratio’. In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. For example, if a bowl of fruit contains ‘eight’ oranges and ‘six’ lemons, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Thus, a ratio can also be a fraction as opposed to a whole number. In addition, in this example the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4), and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7). The numbers compared in a ratio can be any quantities of a comparable kind, such as objects, persons, lengths, or spoonful amounts. A ratio is written \"a to b\" or ‘a : b’ or sometimes expressed arithmetically as a ‘quotient’ of the two.\n\nLiquidity Ratios\n\nThe current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures whether or not a firm has enough resources to meet its short-term obligations. It compares a firm's current assets to its current liabilities. The current ratio is an indication of a firm's liquidity. Acceptable current ratios vary from industry to industry. In many cases, a creditor would consider a high current ratio to be better than a low current ratio, because a high current ratio indicates that the company is more likely to pay the creditor back. Large current ratios are not always a good sign for investors. If the company's current ratio calculates too high it may indicate that, th",

A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions (assuming that the variable x has been assigned a value):\n\n```17\nx\nx + 17\n```\n\nA statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two kinds of statement: print and assignment.\n\nTechnically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement does not.\n\n15.06: Interactive Mode and Script Mode\n\nOne of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. But there are differences between interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing.\n\nFor example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type\n\n```>>> miles = 26.2\n>>> miles * 1.61\n42.182\n```\n\nThe first line assigns a value to `miles`, but it has no visible effect. The second line is an expression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. So we learn that a marathon is about 42 kilometers.\n\nBut if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python actually evaluates the expression, but it doesn’t display the value unless you tell it to:\n\n```miles = 26.2\nprint miles * 1.61\n```\n\nThis behavior can be confusing at first.\n\nA script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.\n\nFor example, the script\n\n```print 1\nx = 2\nprint x\n```\n\nproduces the output\n\n```1\n2\n```\n\nThe assignment statement produces no output.\n\nExercise \\(1\\)\n\nType the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:\n\n```5\nx = 5\nx + 1\n```\n\nNow put the same statements into a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.\n\n15.07: Order of Operations\n\nWhen more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:\n\n• Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, `2 * (3-1)` is 4, and `(1+1)**(5-2)` is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in `(minute * 100) / 60`, even if it doesn’t change the result.\n• Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so `2**1+1` is 3, not 4, and `3*1**3` is 3, not 27.\n• Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So `2*3-1` is 5, not 4, and `6+4/2` ",

It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Saudi Arabia to the south, Iran to the east, the Arabian Gulf, Kuwait to the southeast, Syria to the west, and Jordan to the southwest. The climate of Iraq has mild winters and hot summers. The country's mountainous regions, however, have very cold winters and mild summers.\n\nIraq is known as Mesopotamia because its land lies between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. It is considered one of the most prominent countries rich in natural resources, so ancient civilizations flourished in that region to become home to the oldest civilizations in the world. Today, Iraq is famous for its ancient history and its archeological sites, which were established thousands of years BC. One of the most famous archeological places in Iraq are: Ziggurat of Ur زقورة أور , Babylon بابل , Samarra ملوية سامراء , Hatra الحضر, Taq Kasra طاق كسرى , Rabban Hormizd Monastery دير الربان هرمزد , Erbil Citadel قلعة أربيل. Watch the videos of the three historical and ancient places in Iraq.\n\nHistorical Places in Iraq\nHistorical Place Video\n\nIraq is divided into 18 governorates, and these governorates are divided into districts, and the number of districts is 120, and this district divided into other, less important divisions called nahiyas. Baghdad is the capital of Iraq and the most populous. The most famous cities in Iraq after Baghdad are Mosul, Basra, Babylon, Erbil, Duhok, Sulaymaniyah, Karbala, Kirkuk, and Najaf.\n\nFamous Cities in Iraq\nCity Name Image Details\n\nBaghdad / بغداد\n\nBaghdad is a city on a somewhat flat land.

For example, $[c,b,a]$ is a permutation of the set $\\{a,b,c\\}$ of three objects. Likewise, [triangle, melon, airplane] is a permutation of three objects as well. From our mathematical point of view, the objects we use don't actually matter; all we care about is the order they are arranged in. So usually we'll just talk about permutations of the numbers $1$ through $n$. You can think of each number as just counting the objects involved: first object, second object, $n$th object.\n\nPermutations arise in the world in a many, many ways. For example, suppose you are asked to list your preferences amongst a bunch of presidential candidates. The list you make up, from favorite to least favorite, is a permutation of the candidates. In fact, you can use the mathematics of permutations to learn interesting things about different kinds of voting systems.\n\nAnother example is a deck of playing cards. In a standard deck, each card appears exactly once. When you shuffle the deck, you are just creating a random permutation of the cards. One can use mathematics related to permutations to answer interesting questions about cards. Like: 'How many times do I need to shuffle the deck before it is truly randomized?' The answer, by the way, seems to be 7 for a standard riffle shuffle. But proving that is well beyond the scope of these notes!\n\nBecause permutations are so common, problems involving permutations tend to be very applicable! For example, suppose you have two hundred students in a class and they all hand in an exam. The stack of exams they give you is a permutation of the students; most likely, the list of student scores you keep is alphabetical. This suggests a problem: What is the fastest way to sort the exams? (In fact, sorting is a fundamental problem in computer science.)\n\nHow many permutations are there of a set of $n$ objects? Suppose we try to build a permutation by successively choosing objects. Then there are $n$ choices for the first object, $n-1$ choices for the second, and so on, until there is only one choice for the last object. Then to get the total number of possible permutations, we multiply these numbers together, and get $n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots 1$. This number, if you haven't seen it before, is called $n$-factorial, written $n!$.\n\nWrite out all of the permutations of the set $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. How many are there in all? Find a sensible way to organize your list!\n\nSuppose we have some initial ordering of our objects. The letters $\\{a,b,c\\}$, for example, can be organized alphabetically. Then every permutation we can think of as a mixing-up of this initial order. In this sense, the permutation is a special kind of function from the set of objects back to itself. (By special, I mean it's a bijection, which is to say a one-to-one and onto function.) (TODO: Wikipedia link) A permutation of these objects is then the list $[\\sigma(a), \\sigma(b), \\sigma(c)]$; this list is",

For example, the sampling distribution of sample proportions closely resembles the normal distribution when the sample size is sufficiently large. In this section, we introduce a number of examples where the normal approximation is reasonable for the point estimate. Chapters 5 and 6 will revisit each of the point estimates you see in this section along with some other new statistics.\n\nWe make another important assumption about each point estimate encountered in this section: the estimate is unbiased. A point estimate is unbiased if the sampling distribution of the estimate is centered at the parameter it estimates. That is, an unbiased estimate does not naturally over or underestimate the parameter. Rather, it tends to provide a \"good\" estimate. The sample mean is an example of an unbiased point estimate, as are each of the examples we introduce in this section.\n\nFinally, we will discuss the general case where a point estimate may follow some distribution other than the normal distribution. We also provide guidance about how to handle scenarios where the statistical techniques you are familiar with are insufficient for the problem at hand.\n\nConfidence intervals for nearly normal point estimates\n\nIn Section 4.2, we used the point estimate $\\bar {x}$ with a standard error $SE_{\\bar {x}}$ to create a 95% confidence interval for the population mean:\n\n$\\bar {x} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE_{\\bar {x}} \\label {4.44}$\n\nWe constructed this interval by noting that the sample mean is within 1.96 standard errors of the actual mean about 95% of the time. This same logic generalizes to any unbiased point estimate that is nearly normal. We may also generalize the confidence level by using a place-holder z^*.\n\nGeneral confidence interval for the normal sampling distribution case\n\nA confidence interval based on an unbiased and nearly normal point estimate is\n\n$\\text {point estimate} \\pm z^* SE \\label{4.45}$\n\nwhere z^* is selected to correspond to the confidence level, and SE represents the standard error. The value z^*SE is called the margin of error.\n\nGenerally the standard error for a point estimate is estimated from the data and computed using a formula. For example, the standard error for the sample mean is\n\n$SE_{\\bar {x}} = \\dfrac {s}{\\sqrt {n}}$\n\nIn this section, we provide the computed standard error for each example and exercise without detailing where the values came from. In future chapters, you will learn to fill in these and other details for each situation.\n\nExample $1$\n\nIn Exercise 4.1, we computed a point estimate for the average difference in run times between men and women: $\\bar {x}_{women} - \\bar {x}_{men} = 14.48$ minutes. This point estimate is associated with a nearly normal distribution with standard error SE = 2.78 minutes. What is a reasonable 95% confidence interval for the difference in average run times?\n\nSolution\n\nThe normal approximation is sai",

If points 1 and 2 are only infinitesimally separated, and we call the square of the distance between them $d\\ell^2$, then we could write this rule, that gives the square of the distance as\n\n$d\\ell^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \\tag{1}$\n\nThis rule has physical significance. The physical content is that if you place a ruler between these two points, and it is a good ruler, it will show a length of $d\\ell \\equiv +\\sqrt{d\\ell^2}$. Since it is difficult to find rulers good at measuring infinitesimal lengths, we can turn this into a macroscopic rule. Imagine a string following a path parameterized by $\\lambda$, from $\\lambda = 0$ to $\\lambda = 1$, then the length of the string is $\\int_0^1 d\\lambda (d\\ell/d\\lambda)$. That is, every infinitesimal increment $d\\lambda$ corresponds to some length $d\\ell$. If we add them all up, that's the length of the string.\n\nThere are many ways to label the same set of points in space. For example, we could rotate our coordinate system about the z axis by angle $\\theta$ to form a primed coordinate system with this transformation rule\n\n$z' = z$\n\n$y' = x \\sin\\theta + y \\cos\\theta$\n\n$x' = x \\cos\\theta - y \\sin\\theta$\n\nUnder such a relabeling, the distance between points 1 and 2 is unchanged. Physically, this has to be the case. All we've done is used a different labeling system. That can't affect what a ruler would tell us about the distance between any pair of points. Further, for this particular transformation, the equation that gives us the distance between infinitesimally separated points has the same form. Show that this distance rule:\n\n$(d\\ell')^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2 + (dz')^2 \\tag{2}$\n\napplied to the prime coordinates, gives the same distance; i.e, show that $d\\ell' = d\\ell$. Because this distance is invariant under rotations of the coordinate system, we call it the invariant distance.\n\nWe want to emphasize that the labels themselves, x, y, z or x', y', z' have no physical meaning. All physical meaning associated with the coordinates comes from an equation that tells us how to calculate distances along paths. To drive this point home, note that we could also label space with a value of x, y, z at every point, but do it in such a way that we would have the distance between x, y, z and $x+dx, y+dy, z+dz$ have a square given by\n\n$d\\ell^2 = dx^2 + x^2\\left(dy^2 + \\sin^2y dz^2\\right) \\tag{3}$\n\nFor many readers, this result would look more familiar if we renamed the coordinates $r=x$, $\\theta = y$, and $\\phi = z$ so that we get another expression for the invariant distance,\n\n$d\\ell^2 = dr^2 + r^2\\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2\\right)\\ \\tag{4}$\n\nThis is the usual spherical coordinate labeling of a 3-dimensional Eucli",

There is a general technique called \"partial fractions'' that, in principle, allows us to integrate any rational function. The algebraic steps in the technique are rather cumbersome if the polynomial in the denominator has degree more than 2, and the technique requires that we factor the denominator, something that is not always possible. However, in practice one does not often run across rational functions with high degree polynomials in the denominator for which one has to find the antiderivative function. So we shall explain how to find the antiderivative of a rational function only when the denominator is a quadratic polynomial $ax^2+bx+c$.\n\nWe should mention a special type of rational function that we already know how to integrate: If the denominator has the form $(ax+b)^n$, the substitution $u=ax+b$ will always work. The denominator becomes $u^n$, and each $x$ in the numerator is replaced by $(u-b)/a$, and $dx=du/a$. While it may be tedious to complete the integration if the numerator has high degree, it is merely a matter of algebra.\n\nExample $1\\ Find \\( \\int{x^3\\over(3-2x)^5}\\,dx.$\n\nSolution\n\nUsing the substitution $u=3-2x$ we get\n\n\\eqalign{ \\int{x^3\\over(3-2x)^5}\\,dx &={1\\over -2}\\int {\\left({u-3\\over-2}\\right)^3\\over u^5}\\,du ={1\\over 16}\\int {u^3-9u^2+27u-27\\over u^5}\\,du\\cr &={1\\over 16}\\int u^{-2}-9u^{-3}+27u^{-4}-27u^{-5}\\,du\\cr &={1\\over 16}\\left({u^{-1}\\over-1}-{9u^{-2}\\over-2}+{27u^{-3}\\over-3} -{27u^{-4}\\over-4}\\right)+C\\cr &={1\\over 16}\\left({(3-2x)^{-1}\\over-1}-{9(3-2x)^{-2}\\over-2}+ {27(3-2x)^{-3}\\over-3} -{27(3-2x)^{-4}\\over-4}\\right)+C\\cr &=-{1\\over 16(3-2x)}+{9\\over32(3-2x)^2}-{9\\over16(3-2x)^3}+{27\\over64(3-2x)^4}+C.\\cr }\n\nWe now proceed to the case in which the denominator is a quadratic polynomial. We can always factor out the coefficient of $x^2$ and put it outside the integral, so we can assume that the denominator has the form $x^2+bx+c$. There are three possible cases, depending on how the quadratic factors: either $x^2+bx+c=(x-r)(x-s)$, $x^2+bx+c=(x-r)^2$, or it doesn't factor. We can use the quadratic formula to decide which of these we have, and to factor the quadratic if it is possible.\n\nExample $2\\ Determine whether \\( x^2+x+1$ factors, and factor it if possible.\n\nSolution\n\nThe quadratic formula tells us that $x^2+x+1=0$ when $x={-1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4}\\over 2}.$ Since there is no square root of $-3$, this quadratic does not factor.\n\nExample $3\\ Determine whether \\( x^2-x-1$ factors, and factor it if possible.\n\nSolution\n\nThe quadratic formula tells us that $x^2-x-1=0$ when\n\n$x={1\\pm\\sqrt{1+4}\\over 2}={1\\pm\\sqrt{5}\\over2}.$\n\nTherefore\n\n$x^2-x-1=\\left(x-{1+\\sqrt{5}\\over2}\\right)\\left(x-{1-\\sqrt{5}\\over2}\\right).$\n\nIf $x^2+bx+c=(x-r)^2$ then we have the special case we have already seen, that can be handl",

Meat is almost completely digestible and rates high on the nutritional scale as it contains high levels of proteins, consisting of both essential (indispensable) and dispensable amino acids. Essential amino acids need to be supplied on a daily basis by diet, while the body is capable of producing dispensable amino acids on its own. Meat and other animal proteins can supply all the essential amino acids required for the human body. Meat is also rich in B complex vitamins, such as thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, but the fat-soluble vitamins are not all found in meat. Minerals essential for the diet, with the exception of calcium, are found in meat, including phosphorus, iron, copper, and trace minerals. Table 4 lists the vitamins and main nutrients found in meat and meat products.\n\nTable 4 – Nutrients in meat and meat products (Canadian Professional Meat Cutters Association)\nVitamins Sources\nA Certain oils, egg yolk, mammalian liver\nD Fresh liver oils and fatty tissue\nE Green leafy vegetables, animal organs (pituitary gland, adrenals, pancreas, and spleen), milk, butter, and abdominal fat\nK Green vegetables, potatoes, fruits, and liver oils\nThiamin B1 Meat, liver, and kidney\nRiboflavin B2 Milk and meat\nB6 Red meat, liver, kidney, brain, cod liver, egg yolk, and milk\nB12 Liver, kidney, and egg yolk\nNiacin Liver and red meat\nPantothenic acid Liver, kidney, muscle meat, brain, and egg yolk\nBiotin Liver, kidney, muscle meat, egg yolk, and milk\nFolic acid Liver, kidney, muscle meat, milk, and cheese\n\n1.10: Cholesterol Content in Meat\n\nWhat is cholesterol and why do cooks and meat processors need to know more about it? Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of every cell in the body. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is found in all cells of the body and similarly in the meat of animals. The body makes all of the cholesterol it needs to function normally, but additional cholesterol enters the body through the consumption of animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy.\n\nThere are two types of cholesterol found in the body. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is commonly called “good” cholesterol, as opposed to low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol). LDL and HDL travel in the bloodstream, carrying cholesterol to wherever it needs to go within the body. HDL carries cholesterol back to the liver, where the body can process and remove it, while LDL leaves small traces of cholesterol on the walls of arteries as it travels.\n\nToo much cholesterol, high levels of LDL in particular, may cause atherosclerosis, a condition in which plaque (which is made up of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances found in the blood) is deposited in artery walls, blocking the blood flow to vital organs, which can result in high blood pressure or stroke.\n\nCholesterol levels are measured by the concentration of HDL and LDL in the blood.

VSEPR teaches that it is because they have more room in the equatorial positions and this leads to lower electron‐electron repulsion. The modified Tangent Spheres Model (TSM) [see Bent, H. A. J. Chem. Educ. 40, 446‐452 (1963) for an introduction] calculation below shows that equatorial electrons indeed have a lower energy than the axial electrons, but not for the reason VSEPR postulates.\n\nIn this modified TSM approach an electron is represented as a particle in a sphere of radius R. The wave function for such an electron is the eigenfunction of the kinetic energy operator in spherical coordinates, with energy π2/(2R2) in atomic units, as is shown below.\n\n$\\begin{matrix} \\Phi (r,~R) = \\frac{1}{ \\sqrt{2 \\pi R}} \\frac{ \\sin \\left( \\frac{ \\pi r}{R} \\right)}{r} & \\frac{ - \\frac{1}{2r} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} \\left( r \\Phi (r,~R) \\right)}{\\Phi (r,~R)} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{ \\pi^2}{R^2} \\end{matrix} \\nonumber$\n\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle each spherical wave function (orbital) can accomodate two electrons. These non‐interpenetrating Pauli spheres are surogates for the hybridized atomic orbitals that are frequently invoked in VSEPR explanations.\n\nThere are five such pairs (three equatorial and two axial) in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The trigonal planar hole created by the equatorial electron pairs is occupied by the nuclear kernel (nucleus plus non‐valence electrons). The pockets created by the trigonal planar spheres are occupied by the two axial pairs of electrons. The equatorial electrons and one of the axial pairs is shown in the figure below.\n\nIn the calculations carried out here, the equatorial and axial electron spheres are allowed to have different radii. This means there are two variational parameters in the energy calculation, the radii of the axial and equatorial spherical electron clouds. The nuclear kernel is treated as +10 point charge centered in the trigonal planar hole, and its electrostatic interaction with the valence electrons is its only contribution to the total energy. The contributions to the energy are identified in the table below. These Mathcad calculations are carried out using atomic units.\n\n$\\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Energy Contribution} & \\text{Trigonal Bipyramidal Geometry} \\ \\text{Electron Kinetic Energy} & 6 \\frac{ \\pi^2}{2R_e^2} + 4 \\frac{ \\pi^2}{2R_a^2} \\ \\text{Intra Pair Electron Repulsion} & 3 \\frac{1.786}{R_e} + 2 \\frac{1.786}{R_a} \\ \\text{Inter Pair Electron Repulsion} & 3 \\frac{(-2)(-2)}{2R_e} + 6 \\frac{(-2)(-2)}{R_e + R_a} + \\frac{(-2)(-2)}{2 \\sqrt{ \\left( R_e + R_a \\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{3} R_e^2}} \\ \\text{Electron Kernel Attraction} & 3 \\frac{(-2)(10)}{ \\frac{2}{3} \\sqrt{3} R_e} + 2 \\frac{(-2)(10)}{ \\sqrt{ \\left( R_e + R_a \\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{3} R_e^2}} \\end{bmatrix} \\nonumber$\n\nSeed values for the equatorial and axial radii: $\\begin{matrix} R_e = .2 & R_a = R_e \\end{matrix}$",

The evidence was more indirect: the hypothesis that the Earth is round enabled so many things to be explained that otherwise were unexplainable.\n\nBy assuming that the Earth is round we can explain why Magellan's ship could keep sailing west from Spain yet return to Spain. By assuming that the Earth is round we can make sense of the shape of eclipses of the moon (they are round shadows of our round Earth). By assuming that the Earth is round we can explain why, when we look away from port with our telescope at a ship sailing toward the horizon, the top of the ship disappears after the bottom, not before. By assuming that the Earth is round we can explain why the sun can shine at midnight in the arctic.

A scientific explanation is that the apple fell because it absorbed enough water through its stem that its weight increased above the maximum downward force that the brittle stem could resist.\n\nBecause explaining people's behavior is harder than explaining the behavior of apples, the current principles of psychology are less precise than the principles of physics. Psychologists depend on rules of thumb; physical scientists have deterministic laws that indicate what will happen rather than what might happen. For example, why did Sarah decide not to go out with Wayne when he mentioned he had an extra ticket to the concert? After talking with her, a psychologist might explain her action this way:\n\n1. Wayne suggested that Sarah spend her time doing something she believed wouldn't be interesting to her.\n1. People will not usually do what they have little interest in doing, nor what they perceive to be against their self-interest.\n\nSentence 1 states the relevant initial facts of the situation, and sentence 2 expresses the relevant law of psychology. This law is less precise than the law of gravity. It is only probabilistic, not deterministic, because it doesn't say what will happen but only what probab",

Hellman proposed public key cryptography, which is based on the observation that the encryption and decryption procedures need not have the same key. This removes the requirement that the encoding key be kept secret. The encoding function $f$ must be relatively easy to compute, but $f^{-1}$ must be extremely difficult to compute without some additional information, so that someone who knows only the encrypting key cannot find the decrypting key without prohibitive computation. It is interesting to note that to date, no system has been proposed that has been proven to be “one-way;” that is, for any existing public key cryptosystem, it has never been shown to be computationally prohibitive to decode messages with only knowledge of the encoding key.\n\nThe RSA Cryptosystem\n\nThe RSA cryptosystem introduced by R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman in 1978, is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Though it is not a difficult task to find two large random primes and multiply them together, factoring a 150-digit number that is the product of two large primes would take 100 million computers operating at 10 million instructions per second about 50 million years under the fastest algorithms available in the early 1990s. Although the algorithms have improved, factoring a number that is a product of two large primes is still computationally prohibitive.\n\nThe RSA cryptosystem works as follows. Suppose that we choose two random 150-digit prime numbers $p$ and $q\\text{.}$ Next, we compute the product $n= pq$ and also compute $\\phi(n) = m = (p - 1)(q-1)\\text{,}$ where $\\phi$ is the Euler $\\phi$-function. Now we start choosing random integers $E$ until we find one that is relatively prime to $m\\text{;}$ that is, we choose $E$ such that $\\gcd(E, m) = 1\\text{.}$ Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find a number $D$ such that $DE \\equiv 1 \\pmod{m}\\text{.}$ The numbers $n$ and $E$ are now made public.\n\nSuppose now that person B (Bob) wishes to send person A (Alice) a message over a public line. Since $E$ and $n$ are known to everyone, anyone can encode messages. Bob first digitizes the message according to some scheme, say $\\text{A} = 00, \\text{B} = 02, \\ldots, \\text{Z}= 25\\text{.}$ If necessary, he will break the message into pieces such that each piece is a positive integer less than $n\\text{.}$ Suppose $x$ is one of the pieces. Bob forms the number $y = x^E \\mod n$ and sends $y$ to Alice. For Alice to recover $x\\text{,}$ she need only compute $x = y^D \\bmod n\\text{.}$ Only Alice knows $D\\text{.}$\n\nExample $7.5$\n\nBefore exploring the theory behind the RSA cryptosystem or attempting to use large integers, we will use some small integers just to see that the system does indeed work. Suppose that we wish to send some message, which when digitized is $25\\text{.}$ Let $p = 23$ and $q = 29\\text{",

Understand that various types of bargains may be made illegal by statute, including gambling, some service-for-fee agreements involving unlicensed practitioners, and usury.\n2. Recognize that while gambling contracts are often illegal, some agreements that might appear to involve gambling are not.\n\nOverview\n\nAny bargain that violates the criminal law—including statutes that govern extortion, robbery, embezzlement, forgery, some gambling, licensing, and consumer credit transactions—is illegal. Thus determining whether contracts are lawful may seem to be an easy enough task. Clearly, whenever the statute itself explicitly forbids the making of the contract or the performance agreed upon, the bargain (such as a contract to sell drugs) is unlawful. But when the statute does not expressly prohibit the making of the contract, courts examine a number of factors, as discussed in Section 12.5.1 \"Extension of Statutory Illegality Based on Public Policy\" involving the apparently innocent sale of a jewelry manufacturing firm whose real business was making marijuana-smoking paraphernalia.\n\nGambling Contracts\n\nAll states have regulations affecting gambling (wagering) contracts because gambling tends to be an antiutilitarian activity most attractive to those who can least afford it, because gambling tends to reinforce fatalistic mind-sets fundamentally incompatible with capitalism and democracy, because gambling can be addictive, and because gambling inevitably attracts criminal elements lured by readily available money. With the spread of antitax enthusiasms over the last thirty-some years, however, some kinds of gambling have been legalized and regulated, including state-sponsored lotteries. Gambling is betting on an outcome of an event over which the bettors have no control where the purpose is to play with the risk.\n\nBut because the outcome is contingent on events that lie outside the power of the parties to control does not transform a bargain into a wager. For example, if a gardener agrees to care for the grounds of a septuagenarian for life in return for an advance payment of \\$10,000, the uncertainty of the date of the landowner’s death does not make the deal a wager. The parties have struck a bargain that accurately assesses, to the satisfaction of each, the risks of the contingency in question. Likewise, the fact that an agreement is phrased in the form of a wager does not make it one. Thus a father says to his daughter, “I’ll bet you can’t get an A in organic chemistry. If you do, I’ll give you \\$50.” This is a unilateral contract, the consideration to the father being the daughter’s achieving a good grade, a matter over which she has complete control.\n\nDespite the general rule against enforcing wagers, there are exceptions, most statutory but some rooted in the common law. The common law permits the sale or purchase of securities: Sally invests \\$6,000 in stock in Acme Company, hoping the stock will increase in value, though s",

Cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting products should not be used near children, and adequate ventilation should be maintained during use.[3]\n\n[1] U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: Administration for Children and Families.

Incandescent lighting provides softer light and can be used to focus on areas of learning. Lamps, skylights and natural lighting from windows provide additional lighting options. If fire code allows drape fabric over bright lights to reduce their effect, especially in areas where infants are staring up at lights.\n\nComfort\n\nA comfortable environment everyone can enjoy contributes significantly to a program's quality. Arrange furnishings and equipment so that adults can comfortably observe, supervise, and interact with infants.[2]\n\nAlthough the focus of supportive learning environments for infants and toddlers is on the children, it is essential to create a physical space supportive of educators who spend much of their day on the floor interacting with infants. (The Ohio State University for the US Department of Defense’s Office of Family Policy/Children and Youth, 2021) When caregivers can sit comfortably on the floor, attention is spent engaging in responsive interactions with infants and toddlers rather than finding a comfortable position.[3]\n\nA comfortable environment where adults and children can relax encourages teachers to sit with infants and creates an atmosphere conveying emotional and physical safety to all. Offer places for children and adults to snuggle, like a glider or rocking chair or couch, where adults can hold children in their laps for comforting and quiet interactions.[1]\n\nHaving 1 or 2 adult sized chairs in the room (e.g., a rocker or",

                "source_content": "As noted above, the term landslide is used for a variety of downslope movements of rock and regolith. These movements vary greatly in size, speed, and mode of movement. The simplest to understand (see Figure 10-9), and which are dealt with only briefly here, are rock falls (rapid fall of rock material down a cliff face), rock topples (downslope collapse of an originally vertical slab of rock that becomes detached along vertical fractures from a main rock mass), and rock slides (whereby a tabular mass of rock glides down a slope, which is usually underlain by more of the same rock, with planes of weakness parallel to the slope)\n\nAnother characteristic kind of landslide, in which a large mass of earth or rock material moves downslope along a discrete shear surface of failure, is called a slump (see Figure 10-10). The underlying surface is concave upward, and the mass rotates, in the sense of becoming more and more tilted upslope as it moves downslope. As the head of the slump evacuates the original space, a well- defined steep headscarp develops. The downslope segment of the slump, near the toe, commonly flows out onto the preexisting land surface as an earthflow, often with transverse ridges caused by compression as the earthflow feels the frictional resistance of the underlying surface. Slumps like this typically move slowly—not so fast that you can’t get out of the way. They are especially common in regions with steep slopes, thick layers of regolith rich in fines, and occasional heavy rains. Many have occurred in coastal central and southern California in historic times. In many cases they have been triggered by careless undercutting of the base of a slope during road construction or other excavations.\n\nThe largest and most destructive of landslides originate by failure of enormous masses of partially weathered and strongly fractured rock perched high on a mountain slope. Failure, along a master underlying slip plane, causes the mass of material to accelerate downslope at speeds in excess of a hundred meters per second. Most of the famous landslides in history, and in prehistory as well, have been of this kind. Failure is sometimes triggered by heavy rains, especially in springtime after a thaw, or by undercutting at the base of the slope. Others happen just at random—when the time has come for failure. There may be premonitory slow movement before failure, but prediction is difficult. Volumes of rock material involved can be many cubic kilometers.\n\nIn some cases, these large and rapid landslides have run out for long distances beyond the base of the slope down which they traveled, for several kilometers. The mechanism(s) that allow such long runouts over gentle slopes are not entirely clear. For some such landslides, it’s been proposed, on good theoretical and observational grounds, that the slide became launched into the air, perhaps when moving over a “lip” of bedrock, and then rode on a cushion of compressed air.

There are different types of media suitable for growing different types of cells. Here, we will discuss microbiological cultures used for growing microbes, such as bacteria or yeast.\n\nNUTRIENT BROTHS AND AGAR PLATES\n\nThese are the most common growth media, although specialized media are sometimes required for microorganism and cell culture growth. Some organisms, termed fastidious organisms, need specialized environments due to complex nutritional requirements. Viruses, for example, are obligate intracellular parasites and require a growth medium containing living cells. Many human microbial pathogens also require the use of human cells or cell lysates to grow on a media.\n\nThe most common growth media nutrient broths (liquid nutrient medium) or LB medium (Lysogeny Broth) are liquid. These are often mixed with agar and poured into Petri dishes to solidify. These agar plates provide a solid medium on which microbes may be cultured. They remain solid, as very few bacteria are able to decompose agar. Many microbes can also be grown in liquid cultures comprised of liquid nutrient media without agar.\n\nDEFINED VS UNDEFINED MEDIA\n\nThis is an important distinction between growth media types. A defined medium will have known quantities of all ingredients. For microorganisms, it provides trace elements and vitamins required by the microbe and especially a defined carbon and nitrogen source. Glucose or glycerol are often used as carbon sources, and ammonium salts or nitrates as inorganic nitrogen sources. An undefined medium has some complex ingredients, such as yeast extract, which consists of a mixture of many, many chemical species in unknown proportions. Undefined media are sometimes chosen based on price and sometimes by necessity – some microorganisms have never been cultured on defined media.\n\nThere are many different types of media that can be used to grow specific microbes, and even promote certain cellular processes; such as wort, the medium which is the growth media for the yeast that makes beer. Without wort in certain conditions, fermentation cannot occur and the beer will not contain alcohol or be carbonated (bubbly).\n\nCOMMON BROADLY-DEFINED CULTURE MEDIA\n\nNutrient media – A source of amino acids and nitrogen (e.g., beef, yeast extract). This is an undefined medium because the amino acid source contains a variety of compounds with the exact composition being unknown. These media contain all the elements that most bacteria need for growth and are non-selective, so they are used for the general cultivation and maintenance of bacteria kept in laboratory-culture collections.\n\nMinimal media – Media that contains the minimum nutrients possible for colony growth, generally without the presence of amino acids, and are often used by microbiologists and geneticists to grow “wild type” microorganisms.

Unlike Freud, Erikson believed that we are not driven by unconscious urges. He is considered the father of developmental psychology because his model gives us a guideline for the entire life span and suggests certain primary psychological and social concerns throughout life.[1]\n\nErikson expanded on Freud’s theory by emphasizing the importance of culture in parenting practices and motivations. He also added three stages of social and emotional domains regarding adult development. He believed that we are aware of what motivates us throughout life and that the ego has greater importance in guiding our actions than the id does.[2] We make conscious choices in life and these choices focus on meeting certain social and cultural needs rather than purely biological ones. Humans are motivated, for instance, by the need to feel that the world is a trustworthy place, that we are capable individuals, that we can make a contribution to society, and that we have lived a meaningful life. These are all psychosocial issues.\n\nFigure 1. Erikson’s Lifespan Stages (Image Source: Brianne Thompson)\n\nErikson divided the lifespan into eight stages. In each stage, we have a major psychosocial task to accomplish or crisis to overcome. Successful completion of each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality. Failure to master these tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy. Erikson believed that our personality continues to take shape throughout our lifespan as we face these challenges in living.[3]\n\nThese eight stages form a foundation for discussions on emotional and social development during the life span. However, these stages or crises can occur more than once and can occur at different ages.[4] For instance, a person may struggle with a lack of trust beyond infancy under certain circumstances. Erikson’s theory has been criticized for focusing so heavily on stages and assuming that the completion of one stage is a prerequisite for the next development crisis.[5] His theory also focuses on the social expectations that are found in some cultures, but not in others. For instance, the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity might translate well in the middle-class culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where the transition into adulthood coincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles offer fewer choices. Here is a brief overview of the eight stages[6]:\n\nTable 1. Erik Erikson’s Psychosocial Theory\nName of Stage and Age Description of Stage\nTrust vs. mistrust (0-1 year) The infant must have basic needs met in a consistent way in order to feel that the world is a trustworthy place.\nAutonomy vs. shame and doubt (1-2 years) Mobile toddlers have newfound freedom that they like to exercise and by being allowed t",

Private Policing: The Ethical Dilemma \n\nPolicing in the United States has undergone a metamorphosis since its inception. The Metropolitan Police Acts of 1829 in England had begun the modeling of modern day policing in this country. The Acts provided a blue print and policing in this country has been in a transformational period since. The primary reason for change generally surrounded protection of citizens (Urbanization), service delivery, crime, and global issues. These restructuring exercises have been expedited in the last thirty years, specifically due to the indoctrination of technology in society.\n\nPublic policy must be responsive to the needs of its citizenry. With recent special crimes such as Identity Theft, Cyber Stalking, Cyber Bullying, and most notable the 2016 Presidential election whereby a foreign government may have had influence on the elections. In concert with mitigating illegal acts through cyber technology rises the issue of individual privacy rights. Further complicate the enforcement with Constitutional concerns such as guarding against unreasonable intrusion by government into private citizen person, places and effects.\n\nEnter into this discussion, private security and public policing. Although both often find themselves providing similar service or tasks, they do contrast each other in very distinctive practices. I have frequently been asked about “Big Brothers” over reach. I must ask whom are they speaking? More often than not, the response is government. The following link provides information relative to the two enterprises. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/247182.pdf.\n\nThe ordinary person that purchases a cellular telephone instructively clicks on the “Accept” button indicating that the person agrees with the privacy of information and additional requirements by the supplying company. I suggest that the reader of this material has not taken the time to read the small print. Rather they click accept so they have that article of instant gratification in their hot little hand. The same is generally holds true with most social media packages.\n\n10.02: Protecting Privacy and Individual Liberties\n\nProgress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.” ~ George Bernard Shaw. Ergo if enforcement is going to demonstrate progress in light of new technologies and citizen complacency then the collaboration of private and public entities must be realized. Big brother is not government but rather those that citizens have willy-nilly provided their private information. Private companies have almost exclusively insinuated a pact of information protection between the customer and the service deliver, such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

At the intersection of State and Madison Streets, however, one building with large glass windows and a rounded corner entryway covered with lavish decoration stands out. In contrast to its relatively plain neighbors, the pedestrian’s eye is immediately attracted to the structure’s bronze-colored ground floor and broad white façade stretching twelve stories above it. This is Louis Sullivan’s Carson, Pirie, Scott building, a department store constructed in two stages in 1899 and 1903–04\n\nSullivan’s building is an important example of early Chicago skyscraper architecture, and can also be seen as a fascinating indicator of the relationship between architecture and commerce. The firm of Adler & Sullivan first became known in Chicago in the early 1880s for the design of the Auditorium Building (see below) and other landmarks utilizing new methods of steel frame construction and a uniquely American blend of Art Nouveau decoration with a simplified monumentality.\n\nBy the mid-1890s, Sullivan struck out on his own and wrote his treatise on skyscraper architecture, “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered.” In it, Sullivan analyzed the problem of high-rise commercial architecture, arguing with his famous phrase “form must ever follow function” that a building’s design must reflect the social purpose of a particular space.\n\nSullivan illustrates this philosophy by describing an ideal tripartite skyscraper. First, there should be a base level with a ground floor for businesses that require easy public access, light, and open space, and a second story also publicly accessible by stairways. These floors should then be followed by an infinite number of stories for offices, designed to look all the same because they serve the same function. Finally, the building should be topped with an attic storey and distinct cornice line to mark its endpoint and set it apart from other buildings within the cityscape. For Sullivan, the characteristic feature of a skyscraper was that it was tall, and so the building’s design should serve that goal by emphasizing its upward momentum.\n\nLouis Sullivan, Carson, Pirie, Scott Building, Chicago (while still Schlesinger & Mayer, with original cornice and before addition at right)\n\nBy the turn of the century, Sullivan adapted these ideas to a new context, a department store for the Schlesinger & Mayer company that was soon purchased by Carson, Pirie, Scott. In contrast to Sullivan’s earlier office buildings (like the 1891 Wainwright Building in St. Louis—image right), Carson, Pirie, Scott in downtown Chicago was intended to meet its patrons’ needs in a much different way.

Individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder experience psychosis, which is defined as a loss of contact with reality. Psychosis episodes make it difficult for individuals to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli, causing a significant disturbance in everyday functioning. While there are a vast number of symptoms displayed in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, presentation of symptoms varies greatly among individuals, as there are rarely two cases similar in presentation, triggers, course, or responsiveness to treatment.\n\n12.1.1.1. Delusions. Delusions are “fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of conflicting evidence” (APA, 2022, pp. 101). This means that despite evidence contradicting one’s thoughts, the individual is unable to distinguish their thoughts from reality. The inability to identify thoughts as delusional is likely likely due to a lack of insight. There are a wide range of delusions that are seen in the schizophrenia related disorders to include:\n\n• Delusions of grandeurbelief they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame; belief they are God or other religious saviors\n• Delusions of control– belief that others control their thoughts/feelings/actions\n• Delusions of thought broadcasting– belief that one’s thoughts are transparent and everyone knows what they are thinking\n• Delusions of persecution– belief they are going to be harmed, harassed, plotted or discriminated against by either an individual or an institution; it",

Now students on the university level, in a more technologically advanced age have the chance to write our own textbooks. Not only is this affordable,but it can also be used in the future. One may think we have been thrown into the deep end however with this class we have the chance to walk through the steps of writing our own textbook for future teachers to use as a reference. Individually we are responsible for one article and critiquing our fellow classmates. As a group we have the responsibility of informing the future educators.\n\nA student-written text material is formed by a group of students in grade school, high school, or even at the university level. Students, teachers or professors collaborate to produce a text from which others can learn.\n\nHistory\n\nThe start of the written language can be traced back to cavemen. These cavemen would write on the walls of caves with rocks, clay, and sometimes blood. They did this to teach others where to find food.\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians were among the first to develop a formal language, hieroglyphics, and writing utensils, which included papyrus and a primitive ink. They would also use scrolls to record information. These scrolls could be considered one of the first textbooks. However, according to John Wakefield, University of North Alabama, textbooks were invented by Aelius Donatus, in 4 A.D. in a catechism style. Student would answer a question posed by the teacher (Wakefield, 2008 p 5).\n\nCivilization used the quill and ink on parchment for almost a thousand years.\n\nJumping forward in history, the use of modern style pen and paper, typewriters and most recently computers are used compose our thoughts. There is not much of a jump to make from composing thoughts on a computer to a group of students publishing a textbook.\n\nStudent Work\n\nThe students write articles within the textbook as part of a course in which they are enrolled. This is usually under the guidance of a teacher or professor. Most teachers and students eventually find that they learn best from teaching others.\n\nAs for the process, the students choose an article or two to write with other classmates and get guidance from peers. Then they try to get current and relevant information out to better educate themselves and their fellow classmates.\n\nBut if you wish to know more about the authors, you can look their information up in the About the Authors section of the book.\n\nCredible Information\n\nYou may think, what would students know about writing a textbook? They are just learning the basics. You would be surprised, because when one person becomes a master of some idea or profession they also have to go through a trial in which they learn ",

We can make a second plot of height surfaces on a constant-pressure surface (see figure below). Generally the pressure on average is greater at the equator on a given height surface than it is at the poles. This tilt makes sense if you think about the hydrostatic equilibrium equation because the temperature is greater at the equator than at the poles. Therefore, the scale height is greater, and so pressure decreases with height more gradually at the equator than it does at the poles.\n\nA schematic of constant-pressure surfaces intersecting with constant-height surfaces from the pole to the equator.\n\nCredit: W. Brune\n\nWe can arbitrarily choose one height surface and see how the pressure changes as a function of latitude. We see that it increases from pole to equator (see figure below).\n\nCredit: W. Brune\n\nIf we now arbitrarily choose a constant-pressure surface of, say, 500 mb, then the change in the height on an x–y horizontal plot on the pressure surface also shows an increase from pole to equator (see figure below).\n\nCredit: W. Brune\n\nThus, low pressure on constant-height surfaces is related to low heights on constant-pressure surfaces. As a result of the hydrostatic approximation, for every height there is a unique pressure, so we can replace z with p as the vertical coordinate. We can then look at changes in variables as a function of xand y, but instead of doing this on a constant-height surface, we can do it on a constant-pressure surface.\n\nWe can now show how the equations of motion change when the vertical coordinate is switched from the height, z, to the pressure, p.\n\nConsider first the pressure gradient force (PGF). The figure below provides a schematic of the math.\n\nCredit: W. Brune (after R.

In this section, we survey some of the more common chemistry-related applications of enthalpy and the First Law. While the first two sections relate mainly to chemistry, the remaining ones impact the everyday lives of everyone.\n\nEnthalpy diagrams and their uses\n\nComparison and interpretation of enthalpy changes is materially aided by a graphical construction in which the relative enthalpies of various substances are represented by horizontal lines on a vertical energy scale. The zero of the scale can be placed anywhere, since energies are always arbitrary; it is generally most useful to locate the elements at zero energy, which reflects the convention that their standard enthlapies of formation are zero.\n\nThis very simple enthalpy diagram for carbon and oxygen and its two stable oxides (Figure \\(1\\)) shows the changes in enthalpy associated with the various reactions this system can undergo. Notice how Hess’s law is implicit in this diagram; we can calculate the enthalpy change for the combustion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, for example, by subtraction of the appropriate arrow lengths without writing out the thermochemical equations in a formal way.\n\nThe zero-enthalpy reference states refer to graphite, the most stable form of carbon, and gaseous oxygen. All temperatures are 298 K.\n\nThis enthalpy diagram for the hydrogen-oxygen system (Figure \\(2\\)) shows the known stable configurations of these two elements. Reaction of gaseous H2 and O2 to yield one mole of liquid water releases 285 kJ of heat . If the H2O is formed in the gaseous state, the energy release will be smaller. Notice also that...\n\n• The heat of vaporization of water (an endothermic process) is clearly found from the diagram.\n• Hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which spontaneously decomposes into O2 and H2O, releases some heat in this process. Ordinarily this reaction is so slow that the heat is not noticed. But the use of an appropriate catalyst can make the reaction so fast that it has been used to fuel a racing car.\n\nWhy you cannot run your car on water\n\nYou may have heard the venerable urban legend, probably by now over 80 years old, that some obscure inventor discovered a process to do this, but the invention was secretly bought up by the oil companies in order to preserve their monopoly. The enthalpy diagram for the hydrogen-oxygen system shows why this cannot be true — there is simply no known compound of H and O that resides at a lower enthalpy level.\n\nEnthalpy diagrams are especially useful for comparing groups of substances having some common feature. This one shows the molar enthalpies of species relating to two hydrogen halides, with respect to those of the elements. From this diagram we can see at a glance that the formation of HF from the elements is considerably more exothermic than the corresponding formation of HCl. The upper part of this",

Röntgen was investigating cathode rays in different types of evacuated glass tubes and trying to determine their range in air. He noticed that while the rays were being produced, a screen coated in fluorescent barium platinocyanide would glow. He was intrigued because the screen was too far from the tube to be affected by the cathode rays.\n\nHe assumed unknown rays, X-rays, were being emitted from the walls of the tube while the cathode ray tube was running. To his amazement, Röntgen found that the rays could pass straight through his hand and cast shadows of his bones on the fluorescent screen. He spent several weeks privately investigating the rays before publishing his results at the end of the year.\n\nBragg's Law\n\nBragg's law is the result of experiments derived by physicist Sir William Lawrence Bragg in 1912 and first presented on the same year to the Cambridge Philosophical Society.$^{[1]}$ William Lawrence Bragg and his father, Sir William Henry Bragg, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1915 for their work in determining crystal structures beginning with NaCl, ZnS, and diamond.\n\nAfter Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X rays in 1895, William Henry Bragg pioneered the determination of crystal structure by X-RAY diffraction methods, began a lifelong investigation of the nature of radiation, principally X rays but also alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. After the discovery of the diffraction of X rays by crystals in 1912, Bragg and his son, William L., derived Bragg's law, which relates the wavelength of X rays to the glancing angle of reflection. In 1913 the elder Bragg built the first X-ray spectrometer, which he initially used to study X-ray spectral distributions. Within several years they were able to use this instrument and Bragg's law to derive the structure of crystals and show the exact positions of atoms. Subsequently, they demonstrated that the properties and behavior of a large variety of substances can be related to the position of their constituent atoms.\n\nWilliam Lawrence Bragg went on to become director of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge England. It was at this lab, while he as director, in the early 1950's that J.D. Watson and F.H. C. Crick, using the X-ray diffraction techniques that Bragg pioneered, deduced the double helical structure of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Biotechnology has many forms today: Crime detection, forensic science, recombinant DNA to strengthen plants and animals as well as fetal analysis to detect birth defects just to name a few. None of these would be possible if Watson and Crick had not deduced the structure of DNA using X-ray diffraction. Just as the engineer who is building a tall building must understand steel and cement, a scientist must understand the double helix before she can build a molecule.$^{[2]}$\n\nNobel Prize for Bragg diffraction\n\nAlthough simple, Bragg's law confirmed",

It can be used assess soil health, with higher respiration rates indicating a more active, and thus healthy microbial community. It can also be used as part of a C balance to determine if soil under particular management practices is a net source or sink of C, which has direct application to carbon credits. Respiration rates can also be influenced by the quality of the substrate being consumed by the soil microbes. In this lab you will conduct tests to determine the relative soil health of two soils that have been managed differently for over a decade. The tests include a CO2 burst or a basal respiration test to determine the relative respiration rates, and a slake test to determine the stability of the soil aggregates. You will also work with your classmates to complete the Carbon Cycling problem set.\n\nMaterials\n\n• Two or more soil samples that have been oven-dried at 35-40°C (for the CO2 burst test)\n• Two or more moist soil samples that have been recently collected (for the basal respiration test)\n• Soil roller\n• 30 cc (cm3) soil scoop and striker rod\n• Plastic beaker\n• Mesh screen\n• Pipette set to 9 mL\n• Water\n• Solvita® CO2 burst test paddle\n• Test jar with lid\n• Solvita® low-CO2 test paddle\n• Incubator (optional)\n• Solvita® Digital Color Reader and/or reference color charts\n• Two or more soil peds that are approximately the size of a golf ball\n• Coarse wire mesh or machine cloth\n• Two, 1 L sedimentation columns\n• Soil Carbon Cycling Problem Set\n\nRecommended Reading & Viewing\n\nPrelab Assignment\n\nUsing the recommended reading and videos and the introduction to this lab, consider the questions listed below.

Each day it is common for nurses to make critical decisions regarding the safety, appropriateness, and effectiveness of the medications administered to their patients. Examples of decisions that a nurse might make during patient care include:\n\n• Is my patient’s heart rate within the correct range to receive this beta-blocker medication?\n• Does my patient have adequate renal function prior to administering this dose of antibiotic?\n• Is this pain medication effective in controlling my patient’s discomfort?\n\nIn order to make safe medication administration decisions, the nurse must have a strong understanding of pharmacology. Symptom management, physical recovery, and individual well-being can be strongly connected to the use of medications in a patient’s treatment plan. Before a student nurse reviews a medication order, checks a medication administration record, or removes a medication from a dispensing machine, it is important to have a foundational understanding of how medications work within the human body. Let’s take a deeper look at the science of pharmacokinetics.\n\n1.02: Absorption\n\nThe first stage of pharmacokinetics is known as absorption. Absorption occurs after drugs enter the body and travel from the site of administration into the body’s circulation. Medications can enter the body through various routes of administration. Common routes to administer medications include the following examples:\n\n• oral (swallowing an aspirin tablet)\n• enteral (administering to the GI tract such as via a NG tube)\n• rectal (administering an acetaminophen [Tylenol] suppository)\n• inhalation (breathing in medication from an inhaler)\n• intramuscular (getting a flu shot in the deltoid muscle)\n• subcutaneous (injecting insulin into the fat tissue beneath the skin)\n• transdermal (wearing a nicotine patch)\n\nWhen a medication is administered orally or enterally, it faces its biggest hurdle during absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Medications made of protein that are swallowed or otherwise absorbed in the GI tract may quickly be deactivated by enzymes as they pass through the stomach and duodenum. If the drug does get into the blood from the intestines, part of it will be broken down by liver enzymes, known as the first pass effect, and some of it will escape to the general circulation to either become protein-bound (inactive) or stay free (and create an action at a receptor site). These metabolic effects are further described in the “Metabolism” section later in this chapter. Thus, providers who prescribe medic",
