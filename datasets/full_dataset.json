Geology employs many of the tools and techniques of technical geographers, such as GIS and remote sensing to aid in geological mapping. However, geology includes research that goes beyond the spatial component, such as the chemical analysis of rocks and biogeochemistry.\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe discipline of History has significant overlap with geography, especially human geography. Like geology, history and geography have shared university departments. Geography provides the spatial context within which historical events unfold. The physical geographic features of a region, such as its landforms, climate, and resources, shape human settlements, trade routes, and economic activities, which in turn influence the course of historical events. Thus, a historian must have a strong foundation in geography. Historians employ the techniques of technica"

How might their own positionalities - as individuals with their own social, cultural, and geographical backgrounds - affect the scales they choose to emphasize in their analysis?\n\nFurthermore, how do historians use geographical concepts like proximity, distance, and connectivity to analyze the spatial relationships between people, places, and events? What insights can these concepts offer into understanding historical phenomena, such as the spread of ideas or the movement of people across space?"
