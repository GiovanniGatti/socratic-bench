                    "source_content": "A nomogram, alignment chart or abaque is a graph for calculation. It is a two-dimensional diagram which gives a computation of a mathematical function. \n\nThe field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne (18621938). It was used for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.\n\nA nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. \n\nThe result is got by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth.\n\nUse \nNomograms were widely used for about 75 years. They allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are got quickly and reliably by drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a slide rule, or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. \n\nNomograms have domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. \n\nLike a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device. Like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned.A slide rule is a general-purpose calculator, but a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation. Nomograms can still be used to check an answer from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation.\n\nReferences \n\nEngineering\nMathematical tools",

                    "source_content": "Feelin' So Good is the first video album by American recording artist and actress Jennifer Lopez. It was first released in the United States on DVD and VHS on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony's music and entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. Executively produced by Lopez alongside Cory Rooney and Benny Medina, Feelin' So Good provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. With a run time of one hour, it contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview segments of Feelin' So Good were conducted by Lopez's sister Lynda, who interviews not only Lopez, but also her mother, Medina and her future husband Marc Anthony.\n\nFeelin' So Good received generally favorable reviews from critics, although it was noted that it would be of no interest to those who were not fans of Lopez. It was additionally praised for showing Lopez's transition from her acting career to a music career. In the United States, Feelin' So Good was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the RIAA for shipments of 50,000 units.\n\nBackground \nFrom a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color. She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue an acting career.\n\nAfter a series of co-starring film roles, Lopez received her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice is used for the musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip synching. When asked by an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: \"I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled \"Vivir Sin Ti\", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Records, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6.\n\nTransition from film to music \nDuring production of the On the 6, Lopez was aware of the fact that she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\" Lopez's debut single \"If You Had My Love\" was serviced to radio in the United States on May 4, 1999. The song debuted at 72 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the week of May 15, 1999, and entered the top ten two weeks later. A month after the single's release, it moved to number six, earning the \"Greatest Gainer\" title of the week, and reached the top spot on June 12, 1999. The song dethroned Ricky Martin's \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" as the number-one song in the country; this was the first time a Latin artist followed another Latin artist to the top of the chart since Gloria Estefan's \"Coming Out Of The Dark\" replaced Timmy T's \"One More Try\" in March 1991. Lopez also became the first artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 with their debut single since Britney Spears did with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior. \"If You Had My Love\" stayed atop the Billboard Hot 100 for a period of a month, and remained in the top ten until September of 1999. \"If You Had My Love\" was also a success internationally; topping the charts in countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The song also peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten of seven other countries.\n\n\"No Me Ames\", a duet with American recording artist Marc Anthony was released as a B-side to \"If You Had My Love\" and as the album's second single. The song was promoted by Sony Discos, who released a salsa and a ballad version of the song on their respective radio formats. The surprising success of both \"If You Had My Love\" and the album made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\". Following the release of \"If You Had My Love\" and \"No Me Ames\", three additional singles were released. By the end of 1999, Lopez had successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.\n\nVideo contents \n\"Rather than the usual collection\", Feelin' So Good provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. It contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as \"very slick and promotional\". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez \"comes through energetically\" and without \"much star-ego\". The video album provides very basic information about the singer's career, rather than going too much into detail. The release has been compared to the DVD releases of Mariah Carey. Cory Rooney and Lopez acted as album executive producers of the DVD, while Lopez acted as a video executive producer, alongside Benny Medina. Jeffrey Norskog acted as a video associate producer.\n\nChapters overview \n\nFeelin' So Good opens with a intertitle that features a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for On the 6, artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, \"Why Risk a Music Career?\", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, about the risks of starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the \"next natural step\" in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the \"ultimate\" triple threat – \"the actor, singer and dancer\". Lopez then confers, in the chapter \"Press Tours / Promotions\", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more \"personal\" as it is something that is \"closer to your heart\" and something she \"really believes in\". According to Lopez, by the end of the promotional tour for the album she \"lost\" her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of \"If You Had My Love\" at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown. In the fifth chapter, \"Beginning of the Year\", Lopez discusses her hectic schedule in the beginning of 1999; balancing film events and choosing the album's first single and shooting its music video. Lopez then goes into detail about the concept behind the music video of \"If You Had My Love\". Lopez's sister Lynda makes a formal introduction to the music video, as having a \"special place\" in her heart, and it is shown. Lopez then explains how her duet with Marc Anthony on \"No Me Ames\" came about and the concept of the video. Video footage is shown, as Lopez discusses her first ever live performance, with \"No Me Ames\", in April 1999 at Madison Square Garden alongside Marc Anthony. Following this, the official music video to \"No Me Ames\" is shown.\n\nIn the eleventh chapter of Feelin' So Good, appropriately entitled \"First Number One Single\", Lopez reveals the moment when she found out that \"If You Had My Love\" went number one in the United States. She then went on to discuss the events that occoured during the release week of On the 6 in \"Record Release Week\". Lopez then reveals how she came to record \"Let's Get Loud\" and her performance of the song at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup is shown. In \"Jennifer's Energy\", Medina discusses Lopez's ability to work at late hours of the night. Her 1999 Billboard Music Awards performance of the Hex Hector remix of \"Waiting for Tonight\" is then shown. Lopez then speaks of filming the music video for \"Waiting for Tonight\" and behind the scenes footage on set of the video is shown. She also explains how the Hex Hector remix of the song came about and the alternative music video that was created for it. A megamix video of the original and Hex Hector remix follows. The twentieth chapter, \"Jennifer's Mom\", is an interview with Lopez's mother discussing what was like to see Lopez on television for the first time. Lopez then discusses her surprise to the amount of fans she had and their dedication in \"Fan Support\". In \"Working on Record\", the twenty-second chapter of Feelin' So Good, Lopez discusses the process of writing and recording the album. Lopez's sister Lynda interviews her choreographer Tina Landon on what it is like to work with her, before her 1999 Blockbuster Awards performance of \"If You Had My Love\" is shown. Footage is then shown of Lopez \"goofing around\" during a photoshoot, before the music video to her song \"Baila\" is shown, for the very first time. In \"Film Energy vs. Music Energy\" Lopez compares the difference between the fans of her movies and of her music. In the final interview footage of Feelin' So Good, Lopez explains the concept behind the music video of \"Feelin' So Good\" and why Big Pun and Fat Joe were chosen to be featured on the song. The music video is then shown and is faded out into the end credits.\n\nDVD bonus features \nDigitally remastered with Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, the DVD edition of Feelin' So Good contains interactive menus and instant chapter access to songs. It also contains song lyrics and a biography of Lopez in both English and Spanish, as well as an exclusive photo gallery. Additionally, the video albums contains the music videos to Lopez's songs: \"If You Had My Love\", \"Waiting for Tonight\", \"No Me Ames\", \"Feelin' So Good\" and \"Baila\". It also contains four live televised performances by Lopez in 1999.

Then, her performance at the Billboard Music Awards of the Hex Hector remix of \"Waiting for Tonight\" and lastly her Woman's World Cup Finale performance of \"Let's Get Loud\".\n\nRelease and response\n\nRelease dates and formats \nFeelin' So Good was released on DVD and VHS formats in the United States on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony Corporation's music and entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. It was then released in Canada the following week by CBS Video on DVD and VHS. In the United Kingdom, the video album received a DVD release on January 30, 2001 and a VHS release on April 30, 2001 by SMV Enterprises. Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was released on DVD in Japan on June 20, 2001 by Sony Music Records, and on DVD and VHS in France on April 8, 2002 by Sony BMG. The Region 1 cover features a black and white photo of Lopez during the photoshoot of On the 6, while the Region 2 edition features a golden hue image also taken during the photoshoot of On the 6. Feelin' So Good and Let's Get Loud were released as a two disc DVD set in France on October 20, 2003. Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was re-released on DVD in Japan on November 21, 2007.\n\nCritical reception \nFeelin' So Good received generally favorable reviews from critics. Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD three out of five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will \"greatly enjoy this disc\", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: \"It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although much has been made of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress – I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner\". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the \"Waiting for Tonight\" music video. He concluded by stating that: \"Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout.\"\n\nCertifications\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites \n \n \n \n \n\nJennifer Lopez albums\n2000 albums\nCompilation albums\nLatin music albums\nHip hop albums\nR&B albums",

Smart phones can send and receive data much faster than older phones. The industry uses different standards to label the data transmission rates. 2G was introduced in 1991. 2G means 2nd Generation. 2G phones transmit data at about the same speed as a 56kbit/s (kilobits per second) dial-up modem would get.\n\n3G was introduced in the early 2000s. Depending on where they are, 3G phones vary in speed between about 200kbit/s to 14Mbit/s (megabits per second). This is comparable to a DSL or low end cable modem speed. Most smart phones use 3G technology to make them fast enough to practically use internet and other data features. Faster 4G networks operate in many places, with speeds estimated as fast as 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s (gigabit per second). This is as fast as some computer networks that use ethernet. Many smart phones introduced after 2010 use 4G technology including LTE, as later, even faster version. 5G was introduced in a few places in 2019.\n\nSmartphones are powered by batteries.  The amount of energy they can store is reduced over time, and they become weaker.  This causes the phone to become slower and later to turn itself off without the user asking for it.  Some smartphones are designed so the user is able to take off the rear cover and replace the weakened battery.  Most newer smartphones are not made like this.\n\nUse as camera \nSmartphones are also camera phones.  They are usually not as capable as dedicated cameras.  Some phones have sophisticated camera software allowing such features as independent setting of bitrate, framerate and resolution,.  Such controls have only been adapted starting in the mid-2010s.  As of early 2021, mobile phone chipsets may be capable of 2160p 4K video capture at 120 frames per second.\n\nRelated pages \n Mobile phone\n Android\n iPhone\n Windows Phone\n BlackBerry\n Symbian\n\nReferences",

                    "source_content": "John Wesley (; 2 March 1791) was one of the founders of the Methodist church. He was an Anglican minister and Christian theologian. He was an early leader in the Methodist movement. Wesley's life had three distinct phases. The first at Oxford University with the founding of the \"Holy Club\", the second while Wesley was a missionary priest in Savannah, Georgia; and the third after Wesley's return to England. Throughout his life, Wesley remained within the Church of England. He said that his movement was well within the bounds of the Anglican Church.\n\nEarly life \n\nJohn Wesley was born in Epworth, England. He was the son of Samuel Wesley, a graduate of Oxford, and minister of the Church of England. In 1669, Samuel married Susanna Annesley. Both Samuel and Susanna were raised in the same town.  \n\nIn 1696, Samuel Welsey was appointed the rector of Epworth. This is where John was born. The Wesley children's early education was given by their parents in the Epworth rectory. Each child, including the girls, was taught to read as soon as they can could walk and talk. \n\nDuring his early youth, John Wesley had a deep religious experience. At the age of five, John was rescued from the burning rectory. This escape made deep impression on his mind. He regarded himself as set apart for God, as a \"brand plucked from burning\". \n\nJohn was admitted to the Charterhouse School, London. There he lived (for a while) the religious life in which he had been trained at home. His biographer, Tyerman, says that he went to Charterhouse a saint, but he became negligent of religious duties and left a sinner.\n\nOxford Student \nIn June 1720, Wesley entered Christ Church, Oxford, with an annual allowance of 40 pounds as Charterhouse scholar. His health was poor and he found it hard to keep out of debt. There along with his brother Charles, he followed a strict religious life. He went to church often, prayed and helped people. He visited prisoners in jail. Some of them were condemned to be hanged. He drew up for 1721 a time-table of study, worship and service for each day of the week. This can still be seen in his earliest diary from April 15, 1725 to February 12, 1727.  The Wesley brothers and a few other scholars in his \"Holy Club\" were called \"Methodists\" because they followed this strict method of life.\n\nMissionary to Georgia  \nJohn and Charles went to Georgia as missionary priests in the Anglican church.  Their hope of converting many Indians to Christianity was unfulfilled.  After a failed love affair by John, the brothers returned home.  During the Atlantic crossing a strong storm almost sank their boat.  John was very frightened but noticed that some Moravian Christians were at peace.  This made him think that his faith was not the same as theirs.  They were sure that God had forgiven their sins through faith in Christ.\n\nBeginning of Revival \nIn 1738, he heard a reading of Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans, and penned the now famous lines: \"I felt my heart strangely warmed\". He then knew that God had forgiven him and that he  was accepted by God.  This revolutionized his ministry. Charles had a similar experience of  salvation about the same time. John Wesley wrote many books about Scripture and the Christian life. Charles Wesley helped him with many hymns he wrote. These hymns supported the message that John preached.\n\nPersonality and activities \nWesley travelled constantly, usually on horseback. He preached to many people.  After a while some Anglican leaders told him not to preach in their churches. After that he preached outdoors. Sometimes thousands of people listened to his preaching. His followers stayed in the Anglican Church, but formed \"societies\" to help each other in faith. As the movement grew, Wesley examined and sent out preachers, began aid charities, and cared for the sick.  \n\nHis followers were called Methodists. They spread to many countries. Soon there were many in the American Colonies. After the Revolutionary War there were few Anglican priests in America.  Wesley send two superintendents to care for the Methodists there. Eventually, the Methodists became a separate denomination in both American and England.\n\nReferences \n\n1703 births\n1791 deaths\nAcademics of the University of Oxford\nAlumni of the University of Oxford\nChurch of England clergy\nBible translators\nBritish abolitionists\nBritish Christian hymnwriters\nEnglish theologians\nEvangelists\nMethodists\nChristian missionaries\nWriters from Lincolnshire",

                    "source_content": "Parrots are birds of the order Psittaciformes. There are about 372 species in 86 genera. They are found in most tropical and subtropical regions. The greatest diversity of parrots is found in South America and Australasia.\n\nParrots are intelligent birds. They have relatively large brains, they can learn, and they can use simple tools. Because some species have the ability to make sounds like human voices and have plumages with bright colors, many species are kept as pets. This includes some endangered and protected species.\n\nDescription \nThey have a compact body with a large head and a short neck. Their beaks are short, strong and curved. The two parts of the beak are very strong and used to break fruits and seeds. The tongue is large and strong. Most parrots can fly, though some lost their powers of flight after they came to live on oceanic islands. The kakapo is an example.\n\nParrots have strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet (with two toes facing forward and two toes facing back) that are very useful to climb up trees. Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured. The plumage of cockatoos ranges from mostly white to mostly black, with a mobile crest of feathers on the tops of their heads.  Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism.\n\nParrots are variably-sized. The smallest parrot is the pigmy parrot (Micropsitta pusio) with an adult weight of  and a length of . The hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) is longer than any other species of parrot, although half its length is tail.\n\nBehavior \n\nParrots eat seeds, nuts, buds and other plant material. A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion (dead animal carcasses), while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits. Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows, and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young.\n\nParrots are among the most intelligent birds. The ability of some parrots to make sounds like human voices makes them popular as pets.\n\nConservation \nThe capture of wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss and competition from invasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots  being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds.  Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile  species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.\n\nSome parrots can live up to 80 years. Many parrots can imitate human speech; they can speak simple words if repeated a few times.\n\nOrigins and evolution \nTransposons in the genomes of passerines and parrots are similar, but those in the genomes of other birds are not. This is strong evidence that parrots are the sister group of passerines.\n\nEurope is the origin of the first presumed parrot fossils, which date from about 50 million years ago (mya). The climate there and then was tropical. Several fairly complete skeletons of parrot-like birds have been found in England and Germany. On the whole it seems likely that these are not direct ancestors of the modern parrots, but related lineages which evolved in the northern hemisphere, and which have since died out.\n\nThe earliest records of modern parrots date to about 23–20 mya and are also from Europe. Subsequently, the fossil record—again mainly from Europe—consists of bones clearly recognisable as belonging to parrots of modern type. The southern hemisphere does not have nearly as rich a fossil record for this period as the northern, and contains no known parrot-like remains earlier than the early to middle Miocene, around 20 mya. The first unambiguous parrot fossil (as opposed to a parrot-like one) is found in the Miocene. It is an upper jaw, identical that of modern cockatoos.\n\nRelated pages\nTrue parrots\nLovebird\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n\n \n Animal Diversity Web - Psittaciformes - parrots\n ITIS Report - Psittaciformes\n Tree of Life - Psittaciformes\n World Birds Taxonomic List - Psittaciformes",

Bara attended the University of Cincinnati for two years. She worked in theater productions. She moved to New York City in 1908. She made her Broadway debut in 1908. Most of Bara's early movies were shot at the Fox Studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Bara lived with her family in New York City during this time. She moved to Los Angeles, California to shoot Cleopatra in 1917. This movie became one of Bara's biggest hits. No known prints of Cleopatra exist today. There are many photographs of Bara in her costume as Cleopatra. \n\nBara married American movie director Charles Brabin in 1921. She had no children. She died of stomach cancer on April 13, 1955 in Los Angeles, California. Bara was one of the most popular stars of her era. She was one of the earliest sex symbols in movies. Her femme fatale (deadly woman) roles earned her the nickname \"The Vamp\" (short for vampire). The term \"vamp\" soon became a popular slang term for a sexually predatory woman. Bara made more than 40 films between 1914 and 1926. Only six still exist in their entirety.\n\nOther websites \n \n \n \n \n \n Excerpt from Golden's biography Vamp \n Biography at monash.edu.au\n Amateur film of 1937 Fox Studios fire in New Jersey that destroyed many of Bara's films as well as all of the films of her rival Valeska Suratt, the 1921 The Queen of Sheba and several early starring vehicles of John Gilbert\n Theda Bara photo gallery NY Public Library Billy Rose collection\n Literature on Theda Bara\n\nSilent movie actors\n1885 births\n1955 deaths",

He is often called Diego de Velázquez by Dominican historians (that is the name used in the Appleton's Cyclopedia).\n\nHe was born in Cuéllar, near Segovia, Spain. He came to America in the second voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1493. He spent 17 years in the Hispaniola, living most of the time in the southwestern region of the island.\n\nHe worked together with the Spanish governor Nicolás de Ovando in the fight against the Taíno Indians of the region. He founded and governed several towns: Azua de Compostela (1504), San Juan de la Maguana (1503), Bánica (1504), Salvatierra de la Sabana (1504, now Les Cayes, Haiti), Santa María de la Verapaz (near the present Port-au-Prince, Haiti), Villanueva de Yáquimo (now Jacmel, Haiti).\n\nIn 1511, he left from Salvatierra de la Sabana with 300 men and three or four ships to the island of Cuba to conquer that island. He was the first governor of the island and he founded several cities, Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa (the first European city in Cuba and its first capital) in 1511, San Salvador del Bayamo (1513), Santiago de Cuba in 1514 and Havana in 1515.\n\nIn 1517 he sent Juan de Grijalva to explore the coast of Mexico and in 1518 he sent Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to explore the coast of Yucatán. Then in 1519 he sent his secretary, Hernán Cortés, to conquer Mexico with about 450 soldiers but when Cortés got to México (in Veracruz), he broke all relations with Velázquez.\n\nDiego Velázquez de Cuéllar died in Santiago de Cuba in 1524.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n Enciclopedia Libre Universal \n Biography , with a bibliography\nShort biography\n Encarta \n\n1465 births\n1524 deaths\nHistory of Cuba\n15th century in Spain\nSpanish military people",

He was a leader of the Pintupi people during their return to traditional lands in the 1980s. He was one of the founders of the Kiwirrkurra settlement in 1983. As a painter, West was part of the Western Desert movement, and was one of the very first painters of the Papunya Tula school.\n\nEarly life\nFreddy West was born in the Great Sandy Desert sometime in the early 1930s. He was born in the Pollock Hills, north of where Kiwirrkura is today, and lived a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle for the first half of his life. He and his family were mostly based along the western shore of Lake Mackay. They often travelled with another group, led by a man named Waku Tjungurrayi. These families became some of the last nomadic groups left in the desert – most other families having been settled in government stations since the 1950s. In 1962, West decided that he would go and join his relatives, who were living at Papunya. This is traditionally Luritja land, but the Pintupi had become displaced here because of weapons tests being done at Woomera. He met some officers of the Territory's welfare department in the area of Dovers Hills, and arranged for them to take him and his family to Papunya in a year's time. In August 1963, West and his family began to walk to Papunya and met the welfare officers on the way. West had two wives: Parara and Payu, who were sisters of the Napaltjarri skin grouping.\n\nAt Papunya, West started to paint with Geoffrey Bardon. He became one of the first members of the Papunya Tula school, and a shareholder in the company. In the late 1970s, West campaigned strongly within the Pintupi community for them to leave Papunya and return to their traditional country in the west. He moved back west with other Pintupi in 1981 and set up the community of Kintore. He was later an important person in the establishment of Kiwirrkurra, in 1983. He lived there for most of the rest of his life. He married a third wife in October 1984, Takariya Napaltjarri. She was the daughter of Waku Tjungurrayi, and had only come out of the desert a few days before they were married. They soon separated, and Takariya remarried. With his two other wives, West had 15 children. He died in 1994.\n\nPainting\nWest did not paint much compared with many other early Papunya artists. His early works depicted abstract scenes of men's ceremonies, and were very decorated. His later works depicted stories from the Pintupi dreamtime (Tingari), using a motif of circles and lines. He has works in the Australian Museum in Sydney, the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, the Art Gallery of Western Australia in Perth, and the Art Gallery of South Australia in Adelaide.\n\nReferences\n\n1930s births\n1994 deaths\nIndigenous Australian artists\nAustralian painters\nArtists from Western Australia\nArtists from the Northern Territory\nPintupi",

The teacher adapted their questions based on the student's responses, fostering a deep exploration of the topics. However, some questions seemed to circle back on previously discussed ideas without introducing entirely new perspectives, which could have further enriched the discussion. Nonetheless, the Socratic method was effectively applied to guide the student towards a nuanced understanding of Ribeira Square's history and significance.",

                    "source_content": "Coburg (East Franconian: Coborch, Coburch)  is a town on the Itz River in Bavaria, Germany. Its 2005 population was 42,015. It joined with Bavaria by popular vote in 1920. Before 1918, it was the larger of the two capital cities in the united duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nCoburg's Coat of Arms honoring the city's patron Saint Maurice was granted in 1493.\n\nHistory \nCoburg is about 90 km south of Erfurt and about 100 km north of Nuremberg. Coburg was first mentioned in a document dated 1056, although there was a settlement at the site that before then called Trufalistat. Following several changes of noble owners, it came into the hands of the House of Wettin in 1353 when Friedrich III, the Strong, married Katherina von Henneberg. In 1596, it became the capital of one of the new Duchy of Saxe-Coburg under the leadership of Duke Johann Casimirs (ruled 1596-1633).\n\nDue to the royal connections among the royal houses of Europe, Coburg was the site of many royal Ducal weddings and visits. Britain's Queen Victoria made 6 visits to Coburg during her 64-year reign. In 1896 one ceremony brought together Queen Victoria, her son Edward (future Edward VII), her second son Alfred (Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha), her daughter the German dowager Empress Friedrich (Victoria), and many of her grandchildren, such as Tsar Nicholas and Alexandra of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and the future King George V of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1920, two years after the abdication of the last duke, the locals voted to join Bavaria. Thus whilst the other Saxon-Thuringian principalities were later incorporated into the German Democratic Republic after World War II, Coburg became part of West Germany As a result, the town spent the Cold War years lying right next to the Iron Curtain, surrounded by East German territory on three sides.\n\nMain sights \nCoburg has the typical features of a former capital of German little states. There are numerous houses from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The most important landmarks include:\n Ehrenburg, a former Franciscan convent built in 1220 and turned into a castle in 1543-1549, and renovated until the 19th century. The internal decoration dates from the late 17th-early 18th centuries.\n St.-Moriz Church (\"St. Maurice\", 14th-16th centuries), is a Gothic edifice on the Hallenkirche plan with two towers. The interior, remade in 1701, include the notable funerary moment of Duke John Casimir, a 12 m-tall alabaster sculpture painted with statue and reliefs (1595-1598).\n The medieval Veste Coburg, one of the biggest and most beautiful castles in Germany. It was mostly rebuilt in the 19th century. It has a triple line of walls with numerous towers. Martin Luther resided here in 1530. The edifices contain today 3 museums with armories, art galleria, exhibitions and other attractions.\n Casimirium, an elegant Renaissance edifice from 1598.\n Gymnasium Caimirianum, begun in 1601.\n Arsenal (1616-1621).\n Coburg State Theatre\n Coburg Doll Museum\n Callenberg Palace\n Town Hall (1414)\n Castle Rosenau near Coburg\n The Baroque sanctuary at the Basilica of the Vierzehnheiligen, 20 km outside the city.\n\nReligion \nMost residents of Coburg are members of the Evangelical Church (Lutheranism). Other Christian communities are Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, the ICF Movement, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Old Catholics and the New Apostolic Church, as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. There are also three communities of Muslims. Coburg had a large Jewish community until the 1940s. Jews have lived there since the 14th century. The old synagogue was a former church. Today it is used by Old Catholics. Coburg became Protestant after the Reformation. All Catholics were persecuted. A new Catholic community was founded in the 19th century.\n\nDistricts \nCoburg is divided into 15 districts:\n\n Coburg City\n Beiersdorf\n Bertelsdorf\n Cortendorf\n Creidlitz\n Glend\n Ketschendorf\n Löbelstein\n Lützelbuch\n Neu- and Neershof\n Neuses\n Rögen\n Scheuerfeld\n Seidmansdorf\n Wüstenahorn\n\nOver two thirds of Coburg's population live in Coburg City.\n\nFamous people \nAmongst the associated royalty, one individual's 20th century association with Coburg proved especially tragic. This was that of the British Royal Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who was arrested and tried as a Nazi.\n\nBesides various royalty, other famous individuals associated with Coburg include Hans Berger (graduated), William Frishmuth (born), and Eduard Study (born).\n\nIn 1530, Martin Luther stayed in the Veste Coburg to follow negotiations at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg. He also preached at St. Moriz church. \n\nIn 1887, Johann Strauss, the Waltz King, left Vienna when the Roman Catholic Church would not let him divorce his 2nd wife. He moved to Lutheran Saxe-Coburg-Gotha with his future 3rd wife Adele, where he lived the last 13 years of his life in Coburg. He was however buried in Vienna.\n\nIn 1922, Adolf Hitler led several hundred stormtroopers in a march through the city, fighting pitched street battles with leftists. During the Nazi era, the Coburg Badge was one of the most prestigious party medals.\n\nHans Morgenthau, founder of International Relations as a field of study, was born here.\n\nThe US National Hot Dog and Sausage Council asserts that Frankfurt am Main is traditionally credited with originating the Frankfurter. According to the Council, this claim is disputed and that the hot dog was created in the late 1600s by Johann Georghehner, a butcher, living in Coburg.  Coburg was the first German town to elect a Nazi Mayor.\n\nTwin towns \n , Cobourg\n , Gais\n , Garden City\n , Isle of Wight\n , Niort\n , Oudenaarde\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites \n\n Coburg Tourist Board\n World sites atlas \n Schloss- under Gartenverwaltung Coburg\n Aerial view of the Castle\n Lots of Photos from Coburg",

However, there were moments where the conversation seemed to loop back on itself, revisiting similar questions about Sunny's experiences as a DJ and music show host without fully exploring new aspects of her career or the impact of Girls' Generation. Despite this, the teacher generally adhered to Socratic principles, providing clear guidance and modeling intellectual humility. The student demonstrated a growing understanding of the main topics, particularly in connecting Sunny's diverse background and experiences to the global appeal of Girls' Generation.",

The teacher used open-ended questions to encourage reflection on Princess Marina's actions during WWII, such as her charitable work and visits, and how these might have impacted her status among both the public and the royal family. However, the student repeatedly expressed interest in exploring specific events or actions taken by Princess Marina during WWII without moving forward, which could indicate a lack of depth in exploring other aspects of the main topics, like succession rules directly.

The name comes from the Persian word beryā(n) which means \"fried\" or \"roasted\". \n\nThe cooking method of biryani came from Iran. It was brought to the Indian subcontinent by Iranian travelers and merchants. In India, the recipe of biryani developed to its current form. Local variants of this dish are popular not only in South Asia but also in Bangladesh, Southeast Asia, Arabia, and within various South Asian communities in Western countries.\n\nIngredients\nThe spices and condiments used in biryani may include, but are not limited to, ghee, nutmeg, mace, cumin, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint leaves, ginger, onions, and garlic. The premium varieties include saffron. For a non-vegetarian biryani, the main ingredient with the spices is the meat—beef, chicken, goat, lamb, fish or shrimp. The dish may be served with dahi chutney or raita, korma, curry, a sour dish of eggplant (brinjal), boiled egg and salad.\n\nBiryani and pullao are different. In biryani the rice (plain or fried) is cooked separately from the thick sauce (curry of meat or vegetables). The curry and the rice are then brought together and layered.  This makes a dish with contrasting flavors of rice, sauce and meat or vegetables.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n\nPersian food\nIndian food\nRice dishes",

It use one or more magic lanterns to project frightening images  such as skeletons, demons, and ghosts onto walls, smoke, or semi-transparent screens. Typically rear projection was used to keep the lantern out of sight. Mobile or portable projectors were used; this allowed the projected image to move and change size on the screen, and multiple projecting devices allowed for quick switching of different images. In many shows the use of spooky decoration, total darkness, sound effects, (auto-)suggestive verbal presentation and sound effects were also key elements. Some shows added all kinds of sensory stimulation, including smells and electric shocks. Even required fasting, fatigue (late shows) and drugs have been mentioned as methods of making sure spectators would be more convinced of what they saw. The shows started under the [[guise]] of actual séances in Germany in the late 18th century, and gained popularity through most of Europe (especially England) throughout the 19th century.\n\nTheatres\nMovies",

The therapy works in the following ways:\n \"The severed extensions of neurons, called axons, regenerated; \n Scar tissue, which can create a physical barrier to regeneration and repair, significantly diminished; \n Myelin, the insulating layer of axons that is important in transmitting electrical signals efficiently, reformed around cells; \n Functional blood vessels formed to deliver nutrients to cells at the injury site; and (5) more motor neurons survived.\" \n\nThe research was led by Dr. Samuel I.

                    "source_content": "The Shipping Forecast is a weather forecast covering the sea around the United Kingdom and Ireland. It has been broadcast four times a day on BBC Radio 4 since the 1920s.\nThe Met Office, the UK meteorological centre, produces it for the Maritime Coastguard Agency.  The forecast talks about lots of places, starting with  \"Viking\" in the northeast and going  clockwise around the British coastline until it reaches \"Southeast Iceland\" in the northwest. Sometimes the names are changed to keep them the same as in other countries. It is one of the first items on Radio 4 each day, and has been referenced in many poems and songs, including a poem by Seamus Heaney and a song by the British band, Blur (This is a Low).\n\nProtocol \n\nThere is a strict set of rules (a protocol) on how the forecast is written, and it has a limit of 370 words. It is always said in the same way and is around 9 minutes long. The language of the forecast is hard to understand unless the listener understands how the rules work. For example:  People listening to the forecast who know the protocol can understand it as \"In the English Channel, there are strong winds, followed by a stronger wind in less than twelve hours time with some light rain, but good visibility\". The numbers refer to the Beaufort Scale of wind strength. Imminent means within 6 hours, soon between 6 and 12, and later meaning after 12 hours. There are lots of other jargon used in the Shipping Forecast.\n\nSailing By \nAn instrumental piece of music, Sailing By, is played before the 00:45 broadcast of the Shipping Forecast. It acts as a buffer between the news bulletin and the Shipping Forecast, in order to make the Shipping Forecast play at exactly the same time each day. This gives the Radio 4 controllers leeway if the programming of Radio 4 is running late. There was an outcry when it was temporarily taken off air for two years in 1993. Sailing By was written by Ronald Binge, in 1962 a light music composer.\n\nMethods \nThe Shipping Forecast is broadcast in many different ways, most famously, on the radio. BBC Radio 4, the radio station that the Forecast is broadcast from three times a day, can be listened to as far away as Denmark, or can be listened to anywhere in the world via the BBC's website.\n\nNavtex \n\nAn updated Shipping Forecast is broadcast six times a day from three Navtex transmitters placed strategically around the coast of the United Kingdom, giving information on the areas near to the transmitter. The three transmitters are called Cullercoats, Niton and Portpatrick, after the places they are at. Navtex is a type of radio communication that sends a message to a receiver that picks it up and changes it into text, like to a mobiles' text message. The Navtex messages can be received up to 270 miles offshore. Navtex is an acronym for NAVigational TEXt messages. Major areas of general Navtex coverage include the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, Japan and the coasts of North America. Navtex is one of the more common ways of receiving the Shipping Forecast when off-shore.\n\nCoastguard \nThe Maritime Coastguard Agency sends messages every three hours from their sixteen stations that are located by the coast. They also send important navigational notices  and a forecast that is for the area.  The \"Maritime Safety Information\" broadcast includes a part of the Shipping Forecast, specific for the area in question.\n\nOther forecasts \nThere are several related forecasts that are similar to the Shipping Forecast. The High Seas Forecast is similar to the Shipping Forecast in format and protocol, but is about the North Atlantic ocean, or 'Met Area 1'. It can be seen on Radio 4's website. It is also split into lots of areas, and some of them have the same name as in the Shipping Forecast.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites \nRead the Shipping Forecast] \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/shipping_forecast\nBBC radio\nRadio programs\nMeteorology",

It is a medium-sized member of the crow family with glossy black and white plumage and a yellow beak. The yellow-billed magpie lives only in California where it can be found in dry and warm oak savannah and shady valleys along the Central Valley. It is an omnivorous species: Insects and seeds are its main food, but it also takes carrion, small vertebrates and eggs. The breeding season of the yellow-billed magpie starts in April and it takes until the end of June for all chicks to fledge. The birds breed in loose colonies of 3−30 nests and they feed in flocks of several dozens.\n\nJohn James Audubon was the first person to formally describe the yellow-billed magpie. He named it \"Corvus nuttalli\" to honor the naturalist Thomas Nuttall. Within the genus Pica, the species is closest to the North American black-billed magpie (P. hudsonia). Both species share a common ancestor that migrated from Kamtchatka to Alaska some time in the Pleistocene. Black-billed and yellow-billed magpie diverged as a result of the glaciation of the Rocky Mountains. The yellow-billed yagpie became isolated in the warm climate of California and adapted to it. The species' population was hit hard by the outbreak of the West Nile Virus after 1999. It is currently not considered as endangered, but the virus and the degradation of its habitat pose a serious threat to some populations.\n\nReferences \n\nBirds of the United States\nCorvids",

                    "source_content": "To be hanged, drawn and quartered was a punishment in England used for men found guilty of treason. \n\nThe full punishment was made up of the following - the victim was:\n\n Dragged, usually by a horse, on a wooden frame to the place where he was to be publicly put to death. This is one possible meaning of drawn. A more likely meaning of drawn is the  removal of the inner organs. \n Hanged by the neck for a short time or until almost dead (hanged).\n Removed from hanging and placed on a table. Still alive, the victim was cut open in the abdomen and his intestines and sex organs removed (this is another meaning of drawn—see the reference to the Oxford English Dictionary below). The removed organs were burned in a flame, prepared close to the prisoner.\nThe victim's head was cut off, and the rest of the body hacked into four parts or quarters (quartered).\n\nTypically, the five body parts (i.e. the four quarters of the body and the head) would be put on public display in different parts of the city, town, or - in more famous cases such as that of William Wallace - in the country, to discourage would-be traitors who had not seen the execution. After the Crimes Act 1814 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the prisoner was instead hanged until dead - not having to suffer the extremely painful remainder of the punishment while alive. The public display of the bodies of executed prisoners (whether by hanging, drawing and quartering, or some other method) was removed from English criminal law in 1843; drawing and quartering in 1870.\n\nThere is debate among modern historians about whether \"drawing\" referred to the dragging to the place of execution or the disembowelling, but since two different words are used in the official documents detailing the trial of William Wallace (\"detrahatur\" for drawing as a method of transport, and \"devaletur\" for disembowelment), there is no doubt that the subjects of the punishment were disembowelled.\n\nJudges delivering sentence at the Old Bailey also seemed to have had some confusion over the term \"drawn\", and some sentences are summarized as \"Drawn, Hanged and Quartered\". Nevertheless, the sentence was often recorded quite explicitly. For example, the record of the trial of Thomas Wallcot, John Rouse, William Hone and William Blake for offences against the king, on 12 July 1683 concludes as follows:\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary notes both meanings of drawn: \"To draw out the viscera or  the like, to the place of execution\". It states that \"In many cases of executions it is uncertain [which of these senses of drawn] is meant. The presumption is that where drawn is mentioned after hanged, the sense is [the second meaning].\"\n\nThe condemned man would usually be sentenced to the short drop method of hanging, so that the neck would not break. The man was usually dragged alive to the quartering table, although in some cases men were brought to the table dead or unconscious. A splash of water was usually employed to wake the man if unconscious, then he was laid down on the table. A large cut was made in the gut after removing the genitalia, and the intestines would be spooled out on a device that resembled a dough roller. Each piece of organ would be burned before the sufferer's eyes, and when he was completely disembowelled, his head would be cut off. The body would then be cut into four pieces, and the king would decide where they were to be displayed. Usually the head was sent to the Tower of London and, as in the case of William Wallace, the other four pieces were sent to different parts of the country. The head was generally par-boiled in brine to preserve the appearance of the head in display, while the quarters were more often prepared in pitch, for longer-lasting deterrent displays.\n\nReferences\n\nCapital punishment",

Arthur \"Jakie\" Nash (5 September 1914 in Thunder Bay, Ontario – 18 January 2000 in Thunder Bay, Ontario) was a Canadian ice hockey player who competed in the 1936 Winter Olympics as a member of the Canadian ice hockey team, which won the silver medal.\n\nNash was a member of the 1936 Port Arthur Bearcats, which won the silver medal for Canada in ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics. In 1987 he was inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame as a member of that Olympic team.\n\nBackground\nNash was a Goaltender for Port Arthur Bearcats, a hockey team based in Port Arthur, Ontario.  In 1935 the Bearcats were the runner-up in the Allan Cup, which earned him a trip to represent Canada at the 1936 Winter Olympics ice hockey event where he won the Silver Medal. After the Olympics he moved to England and played for the Wembley Monarchs in the English National League from 1936 through 1938. He later returned to Canada and played at least one full season (1941–1942) with the Kimberley Dynamiters of the Alberta-British Columbia Senior League. He was still playing internationally as late as 1948.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\nprofile\nSports-Reference.com: Arthur \"Jakie\" Nash biography\n\n1914 births\n2000 deaths\nCanadian ice hockey goaltenders\nCanadian Olympic silver medalists\nIce hockey people from Ontario\nSportspeople from Thunder Bay",

She is the oldest person from Italy or ever lived in Italy and the oldest living Italian and European person after the death of Maria Redaelli on 2 April 2013.\n\nBiography \n\nShe was born on 29 November 1899 in Civiasco (Province of Vercelli) in the region of Piedmont to Giovanni Morano and Matilde Bresciani, the eldest of eight children, five daughters and three sons. \n\nIn October 1926, she married Giovanni Martinuzzi (1901-1978) and in 1937 her only child was born; unfortunately he died when he was only six months old. The marriage was not happy so in 1938, Morano decided to separate from her husband. On her 115th birthday, Morano was still living alone in her home.\n\nMorano died of heart disease, at her home in Pallanza, Italy, on 15 April 2017, at the age of 117 years and 137 days.

                    "source_content": "Starship is a rocket made by the American company SpaceX. The rocket is made out of stainless steel. The rocket is made of two stages: Super Heavy and Starship. Both of these stages can be used again. This is unusual for a rocket. The rocket is expected to lift  of people and things to orbit. It is expected to travel to the Moon. It is expected to serve space tourists, and also help humans going to Mars.\n\nIn 2023, Starship became  the tallest and the most powerful rocket ever flown.\n\nIn April 2023, a booster rocket and a spacecraft launched. 1 minute 25 seconds into the launch, the booster and the spacecraft could not be steered. The flight continued up to altitude of 39 kilometres (24 mi), then began to tumble.\n\nTest flights and other testing \nIn September 2019, Starship Mk1 (Mark 1) was the first built Starship. The next vehicle, named Mk2, was built in Florida five months later. Mk1 failed [testing at cold temperature, or] the cryogenic proof test. It did not fly.\n\nMk2 was recycled. It did not fly.\n\nMk3's name changed to SN1 (serial number 1). On 28 February 2020, SN1 crushed itself during a cryogenic proof test. It is because of a leak in the bottom tank. On 8 March 2020, SN2's tank completed its only cryogenic proof test. On 3 April 2020, during the SN3 cryogenic proof test, a valve leaked liquid nitrogen inside its bottom tank. This causes the vehicle to lose pressure and crush itself. On 29 May 2020, SN4 had its fifth successful static fire test. But, after the test, the connected propellant pipe made SN4 explode.\n\nOn 4 August 2020, SN5 completed a flight with one Raptor. The rocket went to  before coming down. It is the first Starship spacecraft to complete a flight intact. On 24 August 2020, SN6 repeated SN5's flight and did not explode.\n\nHigh-altitude testing\nSN8 was the first complete Starship. In October and November 2020, SN8 survived four static fire tests. The first, second, and fourth tests were successful, but the third test failed. In the third test, SN8's Raptors destroyed the mount. The concrete layer melted, splashed, and hit a Raptor.\n\nOn 9 December 2020, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) warned SN8 could explode if it was flown as planned. SpaceX ignored its warnings. SN8 then flew up, making it the first Starship to fly. It goes as high as , then comes back down. While landing, SN8's methane header tank did not pump enough methane to the Raptors. This causes one engine to burn itself. So, SN8 hit the ground fast and exploded.\n\nOn 2 February 2021, SN9 flew  high. During the landing, a Raptor does not work. So, SN9 lands at an angle and exploded as well. On 3 March 2021, SN10 repeated SN9's flight. It then landed with all Raptors working. But, because SN10 was damaged, it blew up eight minutes later. On 8 March 2021, the first Super Heavy booster named BN1 (booster number 1) was finished.\n\nOn 30 March 2021, SN11 exploded in dense fog. No one knows why it exploded. A possible explanation is that a Raptor burned SN11's computer. This could let too much propellant flow into the engine's turbopump. When the engine is lit, the pressure inside the chamber is too much, making SN11 explode.\n\nSpaceX did not finish SN12, SN13, SN14. Their improvements were added to SN15 instead. On 5 May 2021, SN15 flew the same flight and landed. It did not explode after launch. On 20 July 2021, BN3 static fired for the only time. \n\nAround July 2021, SpaceX started using the word Ship instead of \"SN\" for Starship spacecrafts. Booster instead of \"BN\" is another name for the Super Heavy boosters.\n\nSuper Heavy and Starship must pass many tests before launch. Firstly, they are filled with nitrogen gas to check for leaks. Then, cold liquid nitrogen fills and drains from Starship and Super Heavy to check the tanks' strength. Finally, propellant fills their tanks, and the Raptor engines are fired. \n\nSince 2005, SpaceX has been working on ideas similar to Starship. The company then checks the design with a series of tests: from flying  high in July 2019, to flying  high in May 2021.\n\nAttempt at orbital flight (April 2023)\nSpaceX tried to do an Orbital test flight in April 2023. The flight did not reach orbit.\n\n\"Three of the 33 engines on the\" booster rocket \"were shut down before the rocket even left the launchpad\", according to media's paraphrasing of Elon Musk; Furthermore, “The system didn’t think\" that those 3 engines \"were healthy enough to bring them to full thrust,” “so they were shut down”, according to Musk.\n\nAt about 27 seconds into the flight, SpaceX lost communications with another engine. \n\nThe flight passed max q. \n\n1 minute 25 seconds into the launch, SpaceX lost thrust vector control and therefore the ability to steer the rocket.\n\nThe flight came up to altitude of 39 kilometres (24 mi), then began to tumble.\n\nAt 29 kilometres (18 mi), about four minutes after liftoff, the (onboard) Autonomous flight safety system destroyed the booster and the Starship. (One source says that \"a self-destruct mechanism\" was triggered.) The time from the triggering to disintegration (or destruction), was 40 seconds. That time is supposed to be much shorter.\n\nThings that should happen before and during an orbital flight \nBefore launch, liquid oxygen and liquid methane fill the tanks of the booster rocket and the spaceship.\n\nEngine chill begins on the booster, at 16 minutes 40 seconds before liftoff. This is to protect the engine's turbopumps from thermal shock. \n\nThe thirty-three engines startup-sequence begins, at eight seconds before liftoff. \n\n33 Raptor engines fire and lift the rocket up. Super Heavy and Starship will then separate. After that, the Starship spacecraft boosts itself into orbit. The booster then descends and lands on the launch tower's arms. When Starship lands, the spacecraft will glide using its flaps. At the last few seconds, the spacecraft flips up and lands.\n\nParts of the Starship system (booster rocket and Starship spacecraft) \nStarship has two parts: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. Both Super Heavy and Starship should be able to land and launch many times quickly. That is the reason why the Starship rocket is often called a fully-reusable rocket. As of November 2021, no other rockets except Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy's booster can do this. Most of the rocket is made from SAE 304 stainless steel, the most common type of all. \n\nA Starship spacecraft lifts off (from Earth) on top of a booster. The spacecraft is supposed to carry  of cargo to low Earth orbit. The Space Shuttle could only carry  to the International Space Station, however. \n\nIn this example, the International Space Station has an even lower orbit than Starship.\n\n{{Efn|The International Space Station orbits  high at 51.64° inclination. Starship in this case orbits  high at 98.9° inclination.\n\nBooster rocket (\"Super Heavy\") \nBelow the spacecraft is a  tall Super Heavy booster rocket. This booster can hold about  of propellant. Super Heavy and Starship's propellants are liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The booster is made from stainless steel rings. These rings are  thick,  tall, and  diameter.\nAt the bottom of the booster are 33 Raptor rocket engines. They can make  of thrust, twice more than the Saturn V. The thrust speeds up the rocket to .\n\nOn top of the booster are four boxes containing fins in a grid pattern. These boxes are usually called grid fins, like those of the Falcon 9. Grid fins rotate to control and guide the booster while falling from the sky. When the booster comes back closer to Earth - just a few kilometers or miles above ground - the booster fires its engines and lands on the tower arms, which will 'catch' it.\n\nSpaceX has two Super Heavy booster rockets, that have not been retired or scrapped (as of 2023's second quarter). They have not gone thru the static fire test.\n\nSpacecraft \n\nOn top of the booster sits a  tall Starship spacecraft. The spacecraft can hold about  of propellant. Its propellant is the same as Super Heavy's, which are liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The Starship spacecraft is made from stainless steel rings, similar to Super Heavy.\n\nAt the bottom of the spacecraft are six rocket engines. Three of them are regular Raptor engines; three others are Raptor Vacuum engines. These regular Raptor engines work inside the air, while Raptor Vacuum engines work inside the vacuum.\n\nThere are two kinds of propellant tanks inside Starship: these are main tanks and header tanks. The main tanks store propellant for almost all functions of the spacecraft. The only exception here is when Starship lands when it uses its header tanks instead.\n\nThere are four flaps that connect to Starship's body. Two large flaps are at the bottom of the spacecraft, and two small flaps are at the top of the spacecraft. They are made from stainless steel sheets and bend to a trapezoid shape. The flaps can control Starship's falling speed and direction.\n\nA black heat shield covers one side of the spacecraft. The heat shield is made from ceramic hexagon tiles and sheets of ceramic wool. They help to protect Starship from hot plasma, made when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere. Starship's heat shield could be durable and used many times.\n\nTypes of Starship spacecraft \n\nStarship HLS (Starship Human Landing System) is supposed to land astronauts on the Moon during the Artemis program. It can take propellant from other Starships to have more range. The spacecraft would not have a heat shield or body flaps. However, it will have solar panels and landing engines. Starship HLS can be fueled and connected to the Orion spacecraft.\n\nRocket engines \n\nBoth Super Heavy and Starship have SpaceX's Raptor rocket engines at the bottom. Each engine can make about  of thrust. It has a full-flow staged combustion cycle design and burns liquid methane with liquid oxygen. \n\nAlso at the bottom of the Starship spacecraft are the Raptor Vacuum engines. They are Raptor engines with larger nozzles. The Raptor Vacuum only works in space and is more efficient than the normal Raptor engine. The Raptor 2 engine is the next generation of the Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines. They will be used in Super Heavy and Starship sometime in the future. \n\nThis is how a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine works. First, liquid methane and oxygen flow into the engine's turbopumps. The turbopumps increase the liquids' pressure. Then, the methane and oxygen evaporate into hot gases in two preburners. One preburner gets more methane, and another gets more oxygen. The gas then turns the turbines and turbopumps by a shaft. These spinning turbines and turbopumps pump more propellant to the engine. This hot and mixed gas is then burned in a combustion chamber. Finally, the engine nozzle directs the ignited gas to make thrust.\n\nRaptor engines will be made in a new factory at McGregor. Both the Raptor Vacuum and Raptor 2 are going to be made in another factory at Hawthorne.\n\nPlanned missions \n\nOn 16 April 2021, NASA (a government agency) selected Starship HLS as the Moon lander for the Artemis program. The other options were the Integrated Lander Vehicle by the National Team and Dynetics HLS by the Dynetics company. NASA then awarded SpaceX $2.89 billion to make Starship HLS. NASA wants Starship HLS to do a landing on the Moon without humans first. Then, Starship will send astronauts for the Artemis 3 mission.\n\nThe dearMoon project has no date for launch (as of 2022). In 2018, Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa announced that private space mission. Its crew are Maezawa himself and eight other people. The plan is to use Starship as the main spacecraft. The spacecraft is supposed to take them toward the Moon, circle around it, and then return back to Earth.\n\nPossibilities for use (or potential uses)\n\nMoving cargo or people between points on Earth  \nIn January 2022, SpaceX got a $102 million five-year contract to develop the Rocket Cargo program for the United States Space Force.\n\nPoint-to-point flights (called \"Earth to Earth\" flights by SpaceX), is the idea of traveling anywhere on Earth in under an hour. John Logsdon, an academic on space policy and history, said point-to-point travel is unrealistic, as [the people on board and] the craft would switch between weightlessness to 5 g of acceleration.\n\nSpaceships going to other planets \nSpaceX wants to start Mars colonization and terraforming. It would do so by sending humans to Mars. Musk's life goal is to ensure that humans are still around after a mass extinction on Earth. He also talked about Starships going to Enceladus, Europa, Pluto, and the Oort cloud. The Starship rocket on those missions could launch from Mars.\n\nSpaceX thinks sending humans to Mars needs many steps. First, some Starships might carry many important things to Mars' surface. Inside them are fertilizer factories, propellant factories, and building materials. The propellant factory takes in carbon dioxide from Mars's air and hydrogen from the ice below. Then, the factory uses the Sabatier reaction. Hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide with hydrogen to create methane and oxygen. Methane and oxygen are Starship's propellants. Filled up with the factory's methane and oxygen, Starship can return from Mars back to Earth. Building materials are used to make domes. They protect farmland from Mars's weather and atmosphere.\n\nMusk has guessed that a city with a million people on Mars is enough to keep itself running. It should be able to create everything that the people need. The city does not need shipments from Earth by then. He guessed that the city needs at least ten thousand Starships full of humans. Each Starship can carry 100 passengers on board. To give the colony enough equipment and food, a hundred thousand Starships carrying cargo might launch to Mars. This guess does not have population growth.\n\nOther possibilities \nMost Starships would carry satellites, cargo, and humans to Earth orbit. They would have a large door that rotates along a hinge. These Starships could catch space debris as well.\n\nSome Starships would carry propellant instead of cargo. These spacecraft can fuel another spacecraft in orbit. Via fueling, these spacecraft would have more range and can go further.\n\nStarships going to Mars also need fueling as well. That spacecraft might have forty rooms, a storage room, and a shelter. The shelter protects astronauts from the Sun's ionizing radiation.\n\nSpaceX wants Starship to replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon 2. Musk guessed a Starship launch should cost $2 million (United States dollars) and the mission's propellant cost should be about $900,000. Starship could carry 400 Starlink satellites into orbit. A Falcon 9 can carry only 60 Starlink satellites.\n\nIn the past, the Starship spacecraft was planned to only bring cargo and astronauts to Mars. However, as of 2021, SpaceX is planning many kinds of Starships that do different tasks. They are different from each other by having parts added, removed, or changed.\n\nThe Starship spacecraft is supposed to carry cargo to higher Earth orbits, the Moon, and Mars.\n\nLaunch and landing places \n\nStarbase is being used (as of 2023) for launches of prototypes. Rockets might also launch from boats, or LC-39A. Starbase at Texas is where SpaceX makes and tests most Super Heavy and Starship. The launch boats are named Phobos and Deimos after the moons of Mars. They were oil platforms owned by Valaris.\n\nAll Starship launch and landing places will have a tower. It has a large crane placed on top that can lift Super Heavy and Starship. That tower also has a pair of steel arms that rotate at a hinge similar to claws. The claws can catch Super Heavy as well.\n\nSome people living near Starbase blamed SpaceX for harming wildlife, building and testing things without permission, and making too much noise. However, many people come to visit and stay there. When asked, they said that watching and imagining Starships sending humans to Mars made them love the place.\n\nTimeline \nNote: The start dates are when rocket stages were first seen, and the end dates are when they are destroyed or not used anymore.\n\nA spaceship and its booster rocket were destroyed in flight, as late as April 2023. \"Ship 24\" (spacecraft) and Booster 7 were used during that flight.\n\n Early ideas \nIn 2005, Elon Musk talked about a launch vehicle named BFR, later known as the Falcon XX. The Falcon XX was never built. Unlike Starship, it could only fly up once. Falcon XX was going to use Merlin 2 engine, a larger version of the Merlin engine. The engines burns kerosene and liquid oxygen.\n\nIn September 2016, at the 67th IAC (International Astronautical Congress), Elon Musk talked about the ITS (Interplanetary Transport System). It was going to be  tall and  wide. The booster was going to have 42 Raptors, and the spacecraft was going to have 9 Raptors. Both the booster and spacecraft are made from carbon composites, and could launch many times. The ITS can carry humans to Mars and other places inside the Solar System. When the spacecraft enters Mars's atmosphere, it cools by transpiration. Transpiration here means the spacecraft flows propellant to the front side and evaporates the heat.\n\nAt the next IAC in September 2017, Musk announced the Big Falcon Rocket. It is sometimes called Big Fucking Rocket. In that IAC, he talked about moving people around Earth quickly with a Big Falcon Rocket. He called it Earth to Earth.\n\nIn November 2018, Musk tweeted about a new spacecraft design. It had three bottom flaps and two top flaps. Around that time, the present names of Starship parts were first used:\n\n the booster stage was named Super Heavy;\n the spacecraft stage was named Starship; and\n the whole rocket was named Starship system or Starship.\n\nIn January 2019, Musk tweeted that Starship will be made from stainless steel instead of carbon composite. He explained that a stainless steel Starship is stronger than a carbon composite Starship. In March 2019, Musk tweeted again that Starships will have a heat shield made of tiles. The heat shield replaces transpiration cooling.\n\nOn 27 August 2019, Starhopper'', the first vehicle to use the Raptor, flew  high. In October 2019, Starship's design had three Raptors and three Raptor Vacuum engines. There are only two bottom flaps in the new design. They are close to the heat shield’s edges.\n\nGallery\n\nNotes and references \n\nRockets\nSpacecraft\nSpaceX",

She is also the first female President of Singapore and first Malay head of state in 47 years since the death of Mr Yusof bin Ishak who was Singapore's first president.\n\nList of presidents\n\nNotes\n\nReferences",

The story is about phonetics professor Henry Higgins. He wagers that he can turn flower girl Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a proper English high society lady.

She won the 1945 Best Actress Academy Award for Mildred Pierce. She was voted the tenth greatest female star in the history of American movies by the American Film Institute.\n\nBiography\nCrawford was born in San Antonio, Texas. Her real name was Lucille Fay LeSueur.  She began her career as a dancer. She moved to Hollywood in 1925. She worked in silent movies. She played hard-working young women who wanted love, romance, and glamor. She made \"talkies\", too. She was given the name \"Joan Crawford\" from a magazine contest sponsored by MGM.\n\nCrawford won the Best Actress Academy Award for Mildred Pierce in 1945.  She made many more movies, but retired in 1970. She died in New York City of a heart attack.\n\nCrawford won success with Letty Lynton (1932). The film is mostly remembered because of the \"Letty Lynton dress\". This dress was designed by Adrian. It was a white cotton organdy gown with large ruffled sleeves, puffed at the shoulder. It was with this gown that Crawford's broad shoulders began to be accentuated by costume. Macy's copied the dress in 1932, and it sold over 500,000 replicas in the United States.\n\nCrawford was married four times. First to actor Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and then to actor Franchot Tone. Her third husband was actor Phillip Terry, and her fourth and last husband was Pepsi executive Alfred Steele. Crawford became active in the Pepsi-Cola company after Steele's death of a heart attack.\n\nCrawford adopted four children: Christina, Christopher, and \"the twins\" Cynthia and Cathy. Christina wrote a bestselling \"tell-all\" biography called Mommie Dearest. This book alleged that Crawford abused her children. It was made into a movie also called Mommie Dearest.\n\nReferences\n\nReferences \nLeese, Elizabeth. (1991). Costume Design in the Movies.

However, the conversation somewhat deviated from the initial main topics as it delved deeply into the specifics of Norman architecture and Viking influences, potentially overlooking a more balanced exploration of commune characteristics and administrative divisions in favor of cultural and historical aspects.

She married her cousin Grand Duke Alexander Mikailovich of Russia and had seven children. During her brother's reign, she lived a private life. However, when monarchy fell, she escaped Russia and lived in England.\n\nEarly life \nGrand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna was born on 6 April 1875 at Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg. Her mother was Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia.\n\nAfter her grandfather died, her father became the Russian king. At this time, Xenia was six years old. It was difficult political time because of terrorist threats. Alexander III moved with his family from the Winter Palace to the Gatchina Palace to protect his family.\n\nXenia, like her brothers, was educated by private tutors. She studied foreign languages very much. Apart from her native Russian, Xenia studied English, French, and German. Xenia also learnt how to cook and make puppets and clothes. She liked to ride, fish, draw, play gymnastics, dance, and perform the piano.\n\nMarriage \n\nXenia and her first cousin once removed, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia, who would also be her husband, used to play together as friends in the 1880s. Alexander was also a friend of her brother Nicholas. In 1886, twenty year old Alexander was in the navy. Eleven year old Xenia sent him a card when his ship was in Brazil, \"Best wishes and speedy return! Your sailor Xenia\". In 1889, Alexander wrote of Xenia, \"She is fourteen. I think she likes me.\"\n\nAt age 15, though Xenia and Alexander wanted to marry, her parents did not want to allow them because Xenia was too young. They were also unsure if Alexander was really very nice. The Tsarina Maria Feodorovna complained that Alexander was too proud and rude. It was not until January 1894 that Xenia's parents allowed them to engage. The couple finally wed on 6 August 1894 at Peterhof Palace. Xenia's younger sister, Olga, wrote about the joy of her the wedding, \"The Emperor was so happy. It was the last time I ever saw him like that.\"\n\nReferences \n\n1875 births\n1960 deaths\nRussian grand dukes and duchesses\nHouse of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov\nExiled royalty",
