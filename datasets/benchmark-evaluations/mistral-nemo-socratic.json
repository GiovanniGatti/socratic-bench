                    "source_content": "Chlorophyll is a pigment that gives plants their green colour. Chlorophyll is a chemical in the chloroplasts of plants. It allows plants to absorb and use light. Energy from the light is used in photosynthesis to make glucose. This contains lots of stored energy which the plant needs to release. It does this through respiration. This energy is then used when the plant grows or repairs damage. Chlorophyll also makes the stem and leaf of the plant green.\n\nChlorophyll is a green pigment in almost all plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, followed by the red portion. However, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum. Chlorophyll was first isolated in 1817.\n\nChlorophyll and photosynthesis \nChlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis, which allows plants to obtain energy from light.\n\nChlorophyll molecules are arranged in and around the membranes of chloroplasts. It serves two main functions. The function of most chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light and transfer that light energy to reaction centres. These pigments are named after the wavelength (in nanometers) of their red-peak absorption maximum. These chlorophyll pigments can be separated in a simple paper chromatography experiment.\n\nThe function of the reaction center chlorophyll is to use the energy transferred to it from the other chlorophyll pigments to undergo a specific redox reaction. In this reaction the chlorophyll gives an electron to an electron transport chain. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O2 gas, and is the source for practically all the O2 in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II.\n\nThe electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to shuttle H+ ions across the membrane, setting up a chemiosmotic potential used mainly to produce ATP chemical energy; and those electrons ultimately reduce NADP+ to NADPH, a universal reductant used to reduce CO2 into sugars as well as for other biosynthetic reductions.\n\nA green sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, has been found to use the chlorophyll it has eaten to perform photosynthesis for itself. This process is known as kleptoplasty, and no other animal has been found to have this ability.\n\nWhy green and not black? \n\nIt still is unclear exactly why plants have mostly evolved to be green. Green plants reflect mostly green and near-green light rather than absorbing it. Other parts of the system of photosynthesis still allow green plants to use the green light spectrum (e.g. through a light-trapping leaf structure, carotenoids, etc.). Green plants do not use a large part of the visible spectrum as efficiently as possible. A black plant can absorb more radiation, and this could be very useful, notwitstandanding the problems of disposing of this extra heat (e.g. some plants must close their openings, called stoma, on hot days to avoid losing too much water). More precisely, the question becomes why the only light absorbing molecule used for power in plants is green and not simply black.\n\nThe biologist John Berman has said that evolution is not an engineering process, so it often has limits that an engineer or other designer does not. Even if black leaves were better, evolution's limitations can prevent species from becoming as efficient as possible. Berman wrote that achieving pigments that work better than chlorophyll could be very difficult. In fact, all higher plants (embryophytes) are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor that is a sort of green algae – so chlorophyll has evolved only once (common ancestor).\n\nShil DasSarma, a microbial geneticist at the University of Maryland, has pointed out that species of archaea use another light-absorbing molecule, retinal, to get power from the green spectrum. Some scientists believe that green-light-absorbing archae were once the most common in the earth environment. This could have left open a \"niche\" for green organisms which would absorb the other wavelengths of sunlight. This is just a possibility, and Berman wrote that scientists are still not convinced of any one explanation.\n\nChemical structure\n\nChlorophyll is a chlorin pigment, which is structurally similar to and produced through the same metabolic pathway as other porphyrin pigments such as haem. At the center of the chlorin ring is a magnesium ion. For the structures depicted in this article, some of the ligands attached to the Mg2+ center are omitted for clarity. The chlorin ring can have several different side chains, usually including a long phytol chain. There are a few different forms that occur naturally, but the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll a. The general structure of chlorophyll a was worked out by Hans Fischer in 1940. By 1960, when most of the stereochemistry of chlorophyll a was known, Robert Burns Woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule. In 1967, the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by Ian Fleming, and in 1990 Woodward and co-authors published an updated synthesis. In 2010, a near-infrared-light photosynthetic pigment called chlorophyll f might have been discovered in cyanobacteria and other oxygenic microorganisms that form stromatolites.\n\nThe different structures of chlorophyll are summarized below:\n\nMeasuring chlorophyll \nChlorophyll Content meters measure the optical absorption of a leaf to estimate its chlorophyll content. Chlorophyll molecules absorb in the blue and red bands, but not the green and infra-red bands. Chlorophyll content meters measure the amount of absorption at the red band to estimate the amount of chlorophyll present in the leaf. To compensate for varying leaf thickness, Chlorophyll Meters also measure absorption at the infrared band which is not significantly affected by chlorophyll.\nThe chlorophyll content of leaves can be non-destructively measured using hand-held, battery-powered meters. The measurements made by these devices are simple, quick and relatively inexpensive. They now have large data storage capacity, averaging and graphical displays.\n\nSpectrophotometry \n\nMeasurement of the absorption of light is complicated by the solvent used to extract it from plant material, which affects the values obtained,\n In diethyl ether, chlorophyll a has approximate absorbance maxima of 428 nm and 660 nm, while chlorophyll b has approximate maxima of 453 nm and 642 nm.\n The absorption peak of chlorophyll a is at 666 nm.\n\nBiosynthesis\nIn Angiosperms, the last step in the synthesis of chlorophyll is light-dependent. Such plants are pale (etiolated) if grown in the darkness. Non-vascular plants and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green in the darkness instead.\n\nChlorosis is a condition in which leaves do not make enough chlorophyll, so they become yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a not having enough iron—called iron chlorosis—or by not having enough magnesium or nitrogen. Soil pH sometimes affects these kinds of chlorosis. Many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can depend on this. Chlorosis can also be caused by pathogens including viruses, bacteria and fungal infections, or sap-sucking insects.\n\nRelated pages\n Xanthophyll\n\nReferences \n\nMolecular biology\nPigments\nNitrogen compounds\nOrganic compounds\nPhotosynthesis\nPlant anatomy",

This governor is chosen by the Queen, but she chooses the person on the advice of the state Premier. The Administrators of the Northern Territory and of Norfolk Island are chosen by the Governor-General. The Australian Capital Territory is governed by the Governor-General.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the Premier. This person is chosen by the state's Governor. Normally the Governor will select as Premier whoever leads the lower house of the state Parliament. However, the Governor can chose someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing mainland territories is called the Chief Minister. The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, is normally whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the Administrator.n.\n\nStatistics\n\nOther websites \n Maps of Australia \n CityMayors article",

The test, first developed in the late 19th century, is widely used in American constitutional law. In short, the Undue Burden standard says the legislature cannot make a particular law that is too burdensome or restrictive of one's fundamental rights.\n\nOne use of the standard was in Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 328 U.S. 373 (1946). In a 7-to-1 ruling, Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed fashioned an \"undue burden\" test to decide the constitutionality of a Virginia law requiring separate but equal racial segregation in public transportation. \"There is a recognized abstract principle, however, that may be taken as a postulate for testing whether particular state legislation in the absence of action by Congress is beyond state power. This is that the state legislation is invalid if it unduly burdens that commerce in matters where uniformity is necessary—necessary in the constitutional sense of useful in accomplishing a permitted purpose.\"\n\nMore recently, the standard has been used in cases involving state restrictions on a woman's access to abortion. The standard was applied by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in her dissent in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 US 416 (1983). O'Connor used the test as an alternative to the strict scrutiny test applied in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).\n\nReferences \n\nUnited States Constitution",

Joe Robbie was the person who gave a good part of the money needed to build the stadium.\n\nRobbie made the stadium with a wider field so that soccer and baseball could be played in the stadium.  The seats that are closest to the field are 90 feet from the sidelines on the football field.  Baseball was played in the stadium as planned, making use of the wider fields.\n\nAfter the stadium was completed, it was named for the person who designed the field, Joe Robbie. The first regular season NFL game that was played in the stadium was a win against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nOther events \nThe Miami Dolphins started playing in the stadium in 1987. The Miami Marlins, when they were known as the Florida Marlins, played there from 1993 through 2011.  The Orange Bowl game has been held in Hard Rock Stadium every year since 1996.  Since the stadium was completed, Madonna, U2, Van Halen, Ozzy Osbourne, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Elton John, Billy Joel, Chicago, Genesis, Gloria Estefan, The Police, Guns N' Roses, The Who, Hall & Oates, Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, and The Three Tenors have all had concerts at the stadium. WWE WrestleMania XXVIII was also held the stadium with a record crowd of 78,363 fans.

                    "source_content": "The Pentagon is the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. It is in Arlington, Virginia (near Washington, D.C.). It has limestone walls. It is in the shape of a pentagon, and has seven floors.\n\nThe Pentagon is the largest office building in the world, but any place in the building can be reached within 7 minutes.\n\nConstruction began on September 11, 1941. Exactly sixty years later, on September 11, 2001, it was hit with an airplane by terrorists. The crash killed a total of 189 victims (125 in The Pentagon, 64 in plane).\n\nBuilding description\nIt has a total floor area of 6,500,000 sq ft (604,000 m2). Offices are 3,700,000 sq ft (344,000 m2). Approximately 25,000 military and civilian employees work in The Pentagon.  It has five sides, five floors above ground, two basement levels, and five ring corridors per floor with a total of  of corridors. The Pentagon includes a five-acre (20,000 m2) central plaza, which is shaped like a pentagon.\n\nThe concentric rings are named (from the center out) as \"A\" through \"E\" (with in addition \"F\" and \"G\" in the basement). \"E\" Ring offices are the only ones with outside views and are generally occupied by senior officials. Office numbers go clockwise around each of the rings, and have two parts: a nearest-corridor number (1 to 10) followed by a bay number (00 to 99), so office numbers range from 100 to 1099. These corridors radiate out from the central courtyard, with corridor 1 beginning with the Concourse's south end. Each numbered radial corridor intersects with the corresponding numbered group of offices (for example, corridor 5 divides the 500 series office block). There are a number of historical displays in the building, particularly in the \"A\" and \"E\" rings.\n\nFloors in The Pentagon are lettered \"B\" for Basement and \"M\" for Mezzanine, both of which are below ground level. The concourse is located on the second floor at the metro entrance. Above ground floors are numbered 1 to 5. Room numbers are given as the floor, concentric ring, and office number (which is in turn the nearest corridor number followed by the bay number). So, office 2B315 is on the second floor, B ring, and nearest to corridor 3 (between corridors 2 and 3). One way to get to this office would be to go to the second floor, get to the A (innermost) ring, go to and take corridor 3, and then turn left on ring B to get to bay 15.\n\nJust south of The Pentagon are Pentagon City and Crystal City, extensive shopping and high-density residential districts in Arlington. Arlington National Cemetery is to the north. The Washington Metro Pentagon station is also located at the Pentagon, on the Blue and Yellow Lines. The Pentagon is surrounded by the Capital Beltway Every day, thousands of commuters traveling between Arlington, Virginia and Washington, DC drive on the roads of the Pentagon Reservation.\n\nThe Pentagon Athletic Center (PAC) is a fitness center for military and civilian staff. It opened in a separate building on the north side of The Pentagon in 2004. Each year, the Pentagon grounds hold the Marine Corps Marathon and the Army Ten-Miler running events.\n\nThe public may take a 60 minute long tour of the building. Tourists can also visit the Pentagon Memorial that is on the building's west side.The Pentagon receives around 106,000 visitors per year.\n\nSome numbers about The Pentagon \nThe Pentagon has:\n 131 stairs\n 19 escalators\n 70 elevators \n 7,754 windows \n 284 toilets\n 691 water fountains\n 4,200 clocks\n 16,250 lights\n 17.5 miles of corridor\n 200,000 telephone calls per day\n 1,000,000 emails sent daily\n 8,700 parking spaces\n\n9/11 Attacks \nOn September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 77 flew into the western side of the Pentagon. September 11 was also the date the Pentagon began to be constructed. There were much fewer deaths because that side was being renovated. 189 people died. There is now a memorial remembering the people who died that day called the Pentagon Memorial.  Each person that died is represented by a bench, for a total of 189 benches. It was opened on September 11, 2008, exactly 7 years after the attacks.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites \n\n The Pentagon website \n\n \nSeptember 11 attacks\n1943 establishments in the United States\n1940s establishments in Virginia",

This was the third armed conflict in the Sri Lankan Civil War between the military of Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers. There were also Eelam Wars I and II before this conflict and Eelam war IV afterwards.\n\nOn the night of 18 July 1996 LTTE forces attacked and overran the military base at Mullaithivu. It was the brigade headquarters of the 215 Sri Lankan Army. About 1,600 soldiers were killed or missing. In April 2000 the LTTE Sea Tigers captured Elephant Pass. This was a major victory since they had lost the last battle at Elephant Pass in 1991. By 2001 both sides were exhausted and ended the war. The LTTE came away with a reputation for their fighting skills. But this led to an Eelam War IV.\n\nCivilian killings\n\nKallarawa massacre \n\nOn 25 May 1995, LTTE (Liberation of Tamil Tigers) killed 42 men, women, and children in Kallarawa, Sri Lanka. Everyone else who lived there escaped the bloodshed.\n\nGonagala massacre \n\nIn the Ampara District of Sri Lanka on 18 September 1999, another massacre took place.

                    "source_content": "Amber is the common name for fossil resin. It occurs in different colours, and is widely used for making jewellery and other ornaments. Although not mineralized, amber is sometimes considered  as a gemstone.\n\nMost of the world's amber is in the range of 30–90 million years old. Semi-fossilized resin or sub-fossil amber is called copal. Baltic amber was called 'Freya's tears' by the Norse and the 'tears of the Heliades' by the ancient Greeks.\n\nAmber consists of several resinous bodies that can mostly dissolve in alcohol, ether and chloroform, associated with a bituminous substance that does not dissolve.\n\nAmber in geology \nAmber is formed from resin coming out of certain trees. It is not tree sap or gum. The resin soon becomes sticky, and later fossilises as amber. The amber can look different depending on its origin, and its later geological history.\n\nTo end up as amber, the starting resin must resist decay. Many trees produce resin, but usually it is broken down by physical and biological process. Exposure to weather tends to disintegrate resin, assisted by microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. For resin to survive long enough to become amber, it must resist such forces, or be produced under conditions that exclude them.\n\nBaltic amber (historically called Prussian amber) is found as irregular nodules in a marine sand, known as blue earth, in the Lower Oligocene strata of Sambia in Kaliningrad Oblast, where it is now systematically mined.\n\nAgathis amber comes from the conifer Agathis, a tree that used to grow over a much wider area.\n\nAmber from America and Africa often comes from the Hymenaea protera, a genus of legume  tree.\n\nAmber inclusions \nThe resin can contain, in addition to the beautifully preserved plant-structures, remains of insects, spiders, annelids, frogs, crustaceans and other small organisms that became trapped while it was fluid. In most cases the organic structure has disappeared, leaving only a cavity, with perhaps a trace of chitin.\n\nLocations and use \nAmber can be found on all continents of the earth, with exception of the pole regions, mainly at the east coast of the USA, Canada, Burma, Mexico, Lebanon, Borneo, Romania and Sicily and other places. According to scientists, the oldest amber originates from the carbon time and has an age of approximately 345 million years (Upper Carboniferous, Northumberland, USA). There is Amber in Mexico and in the Caribbean, mainly in the Dominican Republic. But most of these offer by far a smaller yield than amber found in the Baltic Region around the Baltic Sea. Baltic amber is also the best known amber due to European history. Homer mentions it in his Odyssee, Book 15, 459-465, B.C.E.: “… a necklace of gold, with amber beads was it strung between…”. Amber from the \"New World\" like Mexico and the Dominican Republic was commercially mined only since the last century.\n\nBaltic Amber is found along the shores of a large part of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The greatest amber-producing country is the promontory of Sambia, now part of Russia's Kaliningrad Oblast. About 90% of the world's extractable amber is in the Kaliningrad region of Russia on the Baltic Sea.\n\nThis amber was deposited in the late Eocene and early Oligocene in a delta of a prehistoric river, in a shallow part of a marine basin. In addition to the coast near Kaliningrad, amber is also found elsewhere in the Baltic Sea region. Small amounts of  Baltic amber can even be found outside the Baltic region, for example on the coastline of the south east of England. On the evidence of Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy  (FTIR) analysis of amber and resin from living trees, that conifers of the family Sciadopityaceae were responsible. The only living representative of this family is the Japanese umbrella pine, Sciadopitys verticillata. \n\nResin from the extinct tree Hymenaea protera is the source of Dominican amber and probably of most amber found in the tropics. Dominican amber differentiates itself from Baltic amber mainly by being nearly always transparent, and it has a higher number of fossil inclusions. This has enabled the detailed reconstruction of the ecosystem of a long-vanished tropical forest.\n\nAmber is extensively used for beads and other ornaments, and for cigar-holders and the mouth-pieces of pipes. The Amber Room in the Catherine Palace near Saint Petersburg is notable. It is a reproduction of the original Amber Room, destroyed in WWII.\n\nIn Baltic countries, amber is often treated in autoclave, mainly to produce and enhance the colors and visual effects  thus creating beautiful jewelry. When gradually heated in an oil-bath, amber becomes soft and flexible. Two pieces of amber may be united by smearing the surfaces with linseed oil, heating them, and then pressing them together while hot. Cloudy amber may be made clearer in an oil-bath, as the oil fills the numerous pores to which the turbidity is due. Small fragments, formerly thrown away or used only for varnish, are now used on a large scale in the formation of \"ambroid\" or \"pressed amber\". The pieces are carefully heated with exclusion of air and then pressed into one mass by intense hydraulic pressure, the softened amber being forced through holes in a metal plate. As mentioned, the product is extensively used for making cheap jewelry and articles for smoking.\n\nAmber was much valued as an ornamental material in early times, but also for religious purpose.   Rosary beads are used by Catholics and Muslims alike up too our days. Around 58 A.D., the Roman Emperor Nero sent a Roman knight on a search for this “Gold of the North” and brought hundreds of pounds of amber to Rome. In later days, from 1283 on, the Teutonic Knights, after returning from the crusades, became absolute rulers of Prussia and the Baltic sources of amber, as well as the manufacture of objects made of amber, punishing transgressors with death by hanging. History has it that when they arrived in 1492 at the Caribbean island of “La Hispaniola” (Dominican Republic), Columbus received from a young Taino prince a pair of shoes decorated with Dominican amber, in exchange for a strand of Baltic amber beads that he had offered.\n\nRelated pages\n Amber (colour)\n List of minerals\n Static electricity\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n The World of Amber  A comprehensive website maintained by the Earth Science Department of Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas (Accessed 29 May 2005)\n Publications on amber inclusions \n Baltic amber information page \nhttp://www.webmineral.com/data/Amber.shtml\nhttp://www.mindat.org/min-188.html\nhttp://www.gemstone.org/gem-by-gem/english/amber.html \n\nMinerals",

                    "source_content": "Surabaya, the second largest city in Indonesia, is the capital of East Java. The meaning of Surabaya is combination of sura meaning shark and baya meaning crocodile. There are about 3 million people living in Surabaya and they speak a dialect of Javanese called Suroboyoan. Surabaya is the second largest city in Indonesia after Jakarta. Surabaya is located on the edge of the northern coast of Java Island and dealing with the Madura Strait and Java Sea.\n\nHistorical Places \nThere are many museums and monuments that represents and shows the history of Surabaya.\n\nHouse of Sampoerna \nThe House of Sampoerna is a museum that exhibits from the story of the founder of Sampoerna, Liem Seeng Tee to history of tobacco making. One part of the museum shows the history of how this place was found. It starts from Seeng Tee moving to Indonesia after the death of his wife until how he found the old building of Dutch-supported orphanage. There are displays of Seeng Tee’s old objects such as his bicycle, motorcycle, and equipment and objects related to tobacco. There is a tobacco plant within the building where 3,500 women are rolling Dji Sam Soe cigarettes.\n\nGereja Perawan Maria Tak Berdosa \nGereja Perawan Maria Tak Berdosa is a Catholic church. It is one of the old buildings left from during the Dutch invasion in the 18th century. It is the oldest church in East Java. It has been preserved by the Dutch government in Indonesia. Despite the fact that it is old, the brick stones are undamaged. Without air-conditioning in the hot weather of Indonesia, the temperature inside the church is low and cool. Services were held since 1800s and it still continues today every Sunday in Chinese.\n\nTugu Pahlawan \nSurabaya is not only the second largest city in Indonesia but it is known as the “city of heroes” because of the role it played in the Battle of Surabaya in November 10, 1945. This monument Tugu Pahlawan, Heroes Monument, is the symbol of Surabaya and is built to respect the heroes who fought for independence. This rocket-like monument points towards the moon 41.15 meters high. Along with the monument, there is a museum where diorama of Surabaya in 1945 is displayed. History of Surabaya at that time could be seen through pictures, clips, and stories. There are other buildings surrounding the monument to depict the struggles Indonesians had to go through.\n\nHealth Museum of Dr. Adhyatma \nHealth Museum of Dr. Adhyatma was built in 1990s in order to save and maintain nation's cultural heritage. This museum exhibits historical items related to health and items that are used today.

                    "source_content": "Club Atlético Huracán  is a sports club from the Parque Patricios neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The football team currently plays in the Primera A, the first level of the Argentine football league system. Huracán home stadium is the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.\n\nHuracán was founded on November 1, 1908, in the Nueva Pompeya neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club's name and nickname (Globo, literally \"Balloon\") come from the Huracán balloon flied by Jorge Newbery in 1909. Apart from that, club supporters are called los Quemeros (\"the Burners\") because the stadium is in a former garbage burning area.\n\nDuring the professional era, Huracán won the Primera División title just once (the 1973 Metropolitano), and obtained 4 titles during the amateur era (in 1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). Moreover, Huracán has finished as runner-up of the first division 5 times during professionalism (the last one in the 2009 Clausura).\n\nHuracán's historical rival is San Lorenzo de Almagro.\n\nHistory\nThough officially founded in 1908, there are documents that tell about a previous foundation on May 25, 1903. During the amateur era of Argentine football (1891–1930), Huracán won four championships (1921, 1922, 1925 and 1928). The team was the fifth most successful during that period.\n\nDuring the professional era (started in 1931), Huracán had their moment of glory in the Metropolitano championship of the 1973 season, when they won their only first division title. The team has also won twice the second division (1989–90 and 1999–00). The club has had 4 promotions and relegations during their history. The last promotion came during the 2006–07 season, when Huracán defeated Godoy Cruz in the promotion playoffs.\n\nHuracán was runner-up of the Primera División in the 2009 Clausura. The team, coached by Ángel Cappa and with Mario Bolatti, Matías Defederico and Javier Pastore as key players, was praised for their attacking short-pass style of play. They reached the final game of the season one point above Vélez Zársfield, but lost 1-0 away with that team in the final fixture (in a game with controversial referral decisions).\n\n{|\n|-\n|  style=\"width:198px; vertical-align:top;\"|\nLineup:\n  Gastón Monzón\n  Carlos Araujo\n  Paolo Goltz\n  Eduardo Domínguez\n  Carlos Arano\n  Mario Bolatti\n  Leandro Díaz\n  Patricio Toranzo\n  César González\n  Javier Pastore\n  Matías Defederico\n  Federico Nieto\n  Coach: Ángel Cappa\n|width=\"25\"| \n|valign=\"middle\"|\n\n|}\n\nStadium\n\nThe Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó was closed in May 2008, after cracks were discovered in one of the structural columns. While the stadium was out of commission, Huracán played their home games at Argentinos Juniors. In August 2008, Fernando \"la tota\" Blauzwirn, an old player from the 1940s correctly said \"no veo la hora de volver al Ducó, qué sufrimiento muyayo!\" (I cannot wait until returning to the Duco, guys, what a suffering!).\n\nOn 13 December 2008 during the final weekend of the 2008-09 Apertura championship, Huracán returned to the Ducó, 438 days after they'd last played there. Their 3-0 victory against Vélez was the only game Huracan played at home during their centenary year.\n\nHonoursAmateur Era Primera Division: 41921, 1922, 1925, 1928.Other Amateur Titles Copa Estímulo: 11920\n Copa Ibarguren: 21922, 1925Professional Era Torneo Clausura: 0Runner-up (2): 1994, 2009\n Metropolitano: 11973\nRunner-up (2): 1975, 1976Other professional titles Copa Consuelo: 11933\n Copa Adrián Escobar: 21942, 1943\n Copa Británica: 11944Second Division Primera B Nacional: 31989-90, 1999-00, 2006-07\n\nNotable former playersTo appear in this section a player must have played at least 50 games for the club  Guillermo Stábile (1920–30)\n  Herminio Masantonio (1931–43), (1945)\n  Juan Alberto Estrada (1933–37)\n  Emilio Baldonedo (1935–44)\n  Norberto Méndez (1941–47), (1956–58)\n  Atilio Mellone (League topscorer 1944)\n  Fernando \"la tota\" Blauzwirn (1943–44)\n  Juan Bautista Villalba (1947–48)\n  Edgardo Madinabeytia (1950–58)\n   Eduardo Ricagni (1952–53)\n  Ricardo Infante (1953–56)\n  Néstor Rossi (1959–61)\n  Alfredo Obberti (1962–69)\n  Miguel Angel Loayza (1965), (1967~68)\n  Miguel Ángel Brindisi (1967–76), (1978–80)\n  Carlos Babington (1969–74), (1979–82)\n  Roque Avallay (1970–76), (1980)\n  Alfio Basile (1971–75)\n  Omar Larrosa (1972–76)\n  Jorge Carrascosa (1972–78)\n  Nelson Chabay (1973–75)\n  Alberto Fanesi (1973–77)\n\n  René Houseman (1973–80)\n  Luis Mario Cabrera (1975–76)\n  Osvaldo Ardiles (1975–77)\n  Héctor Baley (1976–78)\n  Rubén Omar Romano (1978–80)\n  Claudio Morresi (1980–85)\n  Oscar Ortiz (1981–82)\n  Claudio García (1981–86), (1996–98)\n  Enrique Vidallé (1982–83)\n  Antonio Mohamed (1987–91)\n  Amilcar Balercia (1986–89), (1993-94)\n   Marcelo Barticciotto (1987–88)\n  Héctor Cúper (1988–92)\n  Fernando Quiroz (1988–93)\n  Hugo Corbalán (1991–98)\n  Jorge Cruz-Cruz (1992–94)\n  Hugo Morales (1992–95)\n  Walter Peletti (1992–96)\n  Héctor Pineda (1993–95)\n  César Couceiro (1993–97)\n  Antonio Barijho (1993–98), (2007–08)\n  Gastón Casas (1994-00)\n\n  Hugo Guerra (1995–98)\n  Sixto Peralta (1996–99)\n  Daniel Montenegro (1997–99), (2002)\n  Rodolfo Graieb (1997-03)\n  Luis González (1998-02)\n  Sebastián Morquio (1999-01)\n  Derlis Soto (2000–02)\n  Christian Cellay (2000–07)\n  Mauro Ramiro Milano (2002–07)\n  Paolo Goltz (2002–10)\n  Mariano Juan (2003–06)\n  Cristian Sánchez Prette (2003–08)\n  Leandro Grimi (2004–06)\n  Joaquín Larrivey (2004–07)\n  Hernán Vigna (2004–07)\n  Leandro Díaz (2007–09)\n  Carlos Arano (2008–09)\n  César \"Maestrico\" González (2008–09)\n  Javier Pastore (2008–09)\n  Mario Bolatti (2009)\n  Luciano Ospina (2010-)\n  Javier Campora (2011-)\n\nRoller Hockey\nThe Club Atlético Huracán''' plays in the main Roller Hockey league of Argentina, the   Liga Nacional Argentina-Serie A1.\n\nteam\nHila\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n Official website \n Patria Quemera \n La Quema Web  \n Semanario Quemero \n\nFootball clubs in Buenos Aires\n1908 establishments in South America\n1900s establishments in Argentina",

It refers to information gathered and steps taken to counter espionage. Other intelligence activities are taken to prevent sabotage, or assassinations by foreign powers, organizations or persons. Activities are taken against international terrorist groups and personnel. Work is done on physical, document or communications security programs.\n\nOften counterintelligence at home is done by a different department from gathering intelligence abroad. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a distinction between the Security Service (MI5) and the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police. Arrests and interrogation is done by Special Branch. Gathering intelligence abroad is done by MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service.\n\nIn theory, the USA has a similar division between foreign activities and homeland activities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is a domestic security service. The CIA has no law enforcement function and does overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. In practice, the set-up is much more complex, and ever-changing. For one thing, the career of James Angleton and also the Watergate scandal shows how the CIA has been involved in mainland USA. The addition of the United States Department of Homeland Security was a recognition that the United States was itself a potential target of attack by its various enemies.\n\nRussia may have been the first country to set up an official counterintelligence organisation: the Okhrana was set up in 1880. Its title 'Department for Protecting the Public Security and Order'. sounds very modern. There was an even earlier Russian security department called the 'Department on Protecting the Order and Public Peace'. It was founded in 1866. It would be fair to say that these Russian organisations were not directed towards foreign intelligence services, but against internal threats to public order. They were part of the MVD (Ministry of the Interior).\n\nReferences \n\nSecurity\nEspionage",

The Spanish introduced it to Asia in the 17th century.\n\nDescription \nThe jícama vine can grow up to a height of 4-5 meters (13-16 feet). Its root can grow up to 2 m (6.5 ft) of length and weigh up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds). The heaviest jícama root recorded weighed 23 kg (51 lb) and was found in the Phillipines in 2010.\n\nReferences \n\nFaboideae\nVegetables",

                    "source_content": "John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, was killed in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, on Friday, November 22, 1963. This happened while he was traveling in a presidential motorcade with his wife Jacqueline, the Governor of Texas John Connally, and the governor's wife Nellie.\n\nShooting and death \nAs the car drove into Dealey Plaza, shots were fired. Kennedy was shot once in the throat, and once in the head. It happened at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC). The motorcade drove to Parkland Memorial Hospital  away. At 1:00 p.m., Kennedy was pronounced dead.\n\nLee Harvey Oswald was the main suspect in the murder. He was arrested on the same day for the murder of a policeman, J. D. Tippit. He was charged with both murders later that night. Oswald denied shooting anyone. Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby two days later, on November 24. This was when Oswald was being moved from the police station to a jail. He died in Parkland Hospital.\n\nThe event left a lasting impression on many worldwide. As with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor before it and the September 11 attacks after it, asking \"Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy's assassination\" would become a common topic of discussion.\n\nInvestigations \nAn investigation into what happened was done by the Warren Commission in 1963–1964. It took 10 months. The commission decided that Oswald was the only person involved, and he had fired three shots from the window of a warehouse on the corner of Dealey Plaza. No one else was involved. The man who murdered Oswald, Jack Ruby, was also said to have acted alone.\n\nMost people at the time believed this was true. However, other alternative theories as to what could have happened have developed. Surveys from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.\n\nAnother investigation was done by the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1979. They found that President John F. Kennedy was probably killed as a result of a conspiracy (a secret plot). The HSCA found both the original FBI investigation and the Warren Commission Report to have big mistakes. They agree with the Commission that Oswald fired all the shots. But they say that there were at least four shots fired. They also say that it was very likely that two gunmen fired at the President. No gunmen or groups involved in the conspiracy were pointed out by the committee. They said that the CIA, the Soviet Union, organized crime and several other groups were not involved.\n\nConspiracy theories \nThe assassination is still the subject of a lot of debate. There are a lot of conspiracy theories. Some researchers have suggested that Oswald was not the shooter. Others have suggested that he conspired with others to kill the president. Most of these theories accuse criminal groups, the military–industrial complex, the government of Cuba, the KGB, or the CIA. Lyndon Johnson, George H. W. Bush and Sam Giancana are among those accused. That mob boss Sam Giancana was responsible is supported by the account of his brother and nephew. Only one person was ever put on trial: Clay Shaw, but he was found not guilty.\n\nSome have also argued that the gunshots were fired so quickly there must have been more than one assassin shooting at the President. This could be supported by the fact that most witnesses said that the second and third shots were fired closer together.\n\nSome believe that the bullets could not have hit Kennedy in the place they hit him if they had really been fired from the warehouse. Many of the workers at Parkland Hospital reported that a large portion of the back of the President's head appeared to have been blown out. This may suggest that he had been hit from the front.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n\nA photo chronology of the seconds leading up to the assassination \nJFK Assassination Records Collection at the U.S. National Archives\nAssassination of John F Kennedy Original reports and pictures from The Times\nBritish Pathé  Online archive of newsreels relating to the assassination\nBBC article on Kennedy's assassination\nThe Kennedy Assassination Encyclopaedia  by John Simkin\n\nJFK Online: JFK Assassination Resources Online by David A.

He was a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. Wilson was elected two times to the Continental Congress, and was a major force in drafting the United States Constitution. He was a leading legal thinker, and he was one of the first six justices appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Wilson was born in Scotland, but lived most of his life in Pennsylvania.\n\nEarly years\nJames Wilson was born in Carskerdo, near St. Andrews, Scotland. His parents were William Wilson and Alison Landall.  Wilson attended a number of universities in Scotland without attaining a degree. Imbued with the ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in British America in 1766, carrying valuable letters of introduction. These helped Wilson to begin tutoring and then teaching at The Academy and College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania). He petitioned there for a degree and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts several months later.\n\nWilson started reading the law at the office of John Dickinson a short time later. After two years of studying, he got the bar in Philadelphia, and, in the following year (1767), set up his own practice in Reading, Pennsylvania. His office was very successful and he earned a small fortune in a few years. By then he had a small farm near Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was handling cases in eight local counties, and was lecturing at The Academy and College of Philadelphia.\n\nOn 5 November 1771, he married Rachel Bird, daughter of William Bird and Bridgette Hulings, they had six children together.\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1774, Wilson wrote a pamphlet saying that the British Parliament had no power in America.  He was for the Declaration of Independence when he was in the Continental Congress.  During the American Revolution, he served in the Pennsylvania State Militia.  He was also attacked at his house by a mob.  This was called the Fort Wilson riot.  Wilson also continued to practice law, and was France's lawyer in the U.S.\n\nWilson was one of the main political economists at the Constitutional Convention.  He gave more speeches than anyone but Gouverneur Morris.  He also proposed the three-fifths compromise, and sat on the Committee of Detail.\n\nWilson served on the United States Supreme Court from 1789 to 1798.  He was the first associate justice nominated by George Washington.\n\nReferences \n\n1742 births\n1798 deaths\nPoliticians from Pennsylvania",

                    "source_content": "The Woodstock Music and Art Festival was a rock music festival at Max Yasgur's 600 acre (2.4 km²) dairy farm in the town of Bethel, New York from 15 to 18 August 1969. It might be the most famous rock concert and festival ever held. For many, it showed the counterculture of the 1960s and the \"hippie era\".\n\nMany of the most famous musicians at the time showed up during the rainy weekend, as can be seen in a 1970 movie, Woodstock. Joni Mitchell's song \"Woodstock\", about the event, also became a major hit song for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. In recent years, a number of attempts were made to recreate it, but the original Woodstock festival of 1969 has proven to be legendary.\n\nThe festival was called \"Woodstock\", because the investment group that backed the concert was called \"Woodstock Ventures.\" It was originally planned for Saugerties, and then the Town of Wallkill, in Orange County (not to be confused with the Hamlet of Wallkill, in Ulster county). People in the Town of Wallkill, meaning those on the Town Board, quickly passed a law that required a permit to hold any gathering for over 5,000 people. A permit was applied for, but it was denied because the portable toilets proposed were considered to be inadequate. A Sullivan County farmer named Max Yasgur heard about the festival and the problems and offered his farm in the Town of Bethel. He was paid $10,000 for the three days.\n\nAlthough all the municipalities were told there would be no more than 50,000, the organizers thought they would get as many as 150,000, and by best counts, there were more than three times that number over the three days. Most did not pay to get in, and the festival lost money as a result. The roads to the concert were jammed with traffic. People left their cars and walked for miles to get to the concert area. The weekend was rainy and overcrowded, and fans shared food, alcoholic drinks, and drugs. Some people who lived there, including those at nearby Camp Ma-Ho-Ge, gave blankets and food to some concert-goers.\n\nAfter two days of rain, there was deep mud in many places. There was almost no water for washing, and not enough toilets. Many of the concert-goers had brought small tents to sleep in; some of these turned into piles of cloth and mud. Even though this may not have been the most comfortable place, the crowd kept up kindness and good cheer among themselves. As the half-million people in the audience became aware of this, a warm feeling of friendship spread to everyone.\n\nSome of the music stars of Woodstock were The Who and Jimi Hendrix. Because of arguments about getting paid, The Who did not play on the stage until about 4:00 in the morning. One part of The Who's show was the song \"See Me, Feel Me\", when the sun rose just as lead singer Roger Daltrey started to sing the chorus. When The Who was still playing, Abbie Hoffman jumped on the stage stopping the show, and tried to stir up the crowd with political slogans, but he was knocked off the stage by the guitar of the band's leader, Pete Townshend, to the delight of the audience. At the end of The Who's set, Townshend slammed his guitar into the stage and threw it into the crowd. This helped set up The Who as super-stars, and caused their album Tommy to sell multi-platinum.\n\nJimi Hendrix had a big show with the songs he played, including a new version of \"The Star Spangled Banner\". The song caused some disagreements, because the Vietnam War was going on, and the sounds that Hendrix made with his guitar were like the sounds of the violence of the war. Fans remember these two acts as some of the greatest in rock history, although both The Who and Hendrix thought of their performances as not the best.\n\nWoodstock was put on by Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, John Roberts and Joel Rosenman. Roberts was the financer, backed by a trust fund; his friend Rosenman, a graduate of Yale Law, was an amateur guitarist. Their friends were Kornfeld, vice-president at Capitol Records, and Michael Lang. Lang was a light-hearted hippie who had owned a head shop, and hoped to build a studio in the Woodstock area to serve singers such as Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, who had homes nearby. When Lang and Kornfeld told the idea to Rosenman and Roberts, Rosenman got the idea of a rock concert with the same musicians. They picked the slogan \"Three Days of Peace and Music\". They hired artist Arnold Skolnick to design the artwork for the poster with the bird. It wasn't until years later, after the release of the 3-LP album and the documentary-like movie that the original investors began to recoup their investment.\n\nIn 1997, the concert place and 1,400 surrounding acres were bought by Alan Gerry, and have become the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts. It opened on July 1, 2006 with the New York Philharmonic playing. On August 13, 2006, Crosby Stills Nash & Young amazed 16,000 fans at the new Center—exactly 37 years after they played at Woodstock.\n\n1969 in music\n1969 in the United States\n1960s in New York (state)\nMusic festivals in the United States\nMusic in New York (state)\nRock festivals\nAugust events",

This distance was more than Marco Polo travelled; about . Ibn Battuta was considered the greatest traveller of the medieval period.\nBattuta also made  maps that were used by cartographers. He also met Mohammad Bin Tughlaq and wrote a book called \"The Travels Of Ibn Battutta\".\nIbn Battuta was born on February 24, 1304 in Tangier. His family consisted of judges and scholars of Islamic law. At age 21, Ibn Battuta started his long exploration when he went on the Hajj. This is a year-long pilgrimage that brings Muslims closer to God. Ibn Battuta first went across North Africa (Maghreb), to the great port Alexandria in 1326. Ibn Battuta spent 30 years visiting every Muslim country of his day. He recorded details about the social and political life he saw on his journeys. He gave information all about Muhammad Bin Tuglaq.\n\nIbn Battuta met a Syrian Arab Damascene girl who was a slave of a black African governor in Mali. Ibn Battuta engaged in a conversation with her in Arabic.\n The black man was a scholar of Islam and his name was Farba Sulayman. He was openly violating the rule in Islam against enslaving Arabs.\n\nChristians became part of harems as slaves in the Balkans and Asia Minor when the Turks invaded. Muslim qadis owned Christian slave girls. Greek girls who were pretty were forced into prostitution after being enslaved to Turks who took all their earnings in the 14th century according to Ibn Battuta.\n\nNotes\n\n1360s deaths\n1304 births\nExplorers\nMoroccan people",

People believe that Colchester is the oldest Roman town in England.\n\nHistory \n\nBefore Roman times, Colchester was Camulodunon. This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos. Camulos was the Celtic god of war. The Romans called Colchester Camulodunum (written \"CAMVLODVNVM\") and made it the capital of Roman Britain. Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD.  The Romans moved their capital of Britannia to Londinium (now London), but Camulodunum remained an important city until the fifth century, when the Saxons conquered the region. \n\nThe Roman town of Camulodunum, officially known as Colonia Victricensis, reached its peak in the Second and Third centuries AD.  It may have reached a population of 30,000 in those centuries, but when the Romans withdrew from Britannia in 410 AD it probably had fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. \n\nThe church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539.  This action was part of the dissolution of the monasteries by King Henry VIII.  Only a gate remains, that people still go to visit.\n\nKing Cunobelinus (or \"Cunobelin\") was from Colchester.\n\nUntil 2022, Colchester was officially a town, not a city. On 5 September, Queen Elizabeth II signed letters patent to grant it city status. This was planned as part of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations. However, she died three days later. On 29 September, these letters were publicly released.\n\nTwin cities \nColchester is twinned with the following cities:\n  Imola, Italy\n  Wetzlar, Germany\n  Avignon, France\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n B D'Ambrosio. \"Roman Camulodunum\".

Hydrogen does not have any neutrons, only a proton. The chemical symbol for Tritium is 3H or T.\n\nIn nature, tritium is made when cosmic rays hit nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere. Tritium has a half-life of a little more than twelve years, so there is not much in the atmosphere. People make much more tritium in nuclear reactors, so that they can make things from it.\n\nWays of using tritium \n\nTritium is important for nuclear fusion power.  Tritium is added to nuclear bombs to make them more powerful when they explode. \n\nTritium is often used with phosphors to make glow in the dark key-rings, and sights on rifles. Tritium makes the phosphors glow because it is radioactively unstable and gives energy to the phosphor so it can make light. Before lots of tritium could be made, people used radium to make things light up but this gave people cancer.\n\nRadioactive decay produces tritium. High levels of tritium were found in 2013 in the Pacific near the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant two years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n\nOther websites \n Tritium -Citizendium \n\nHydrogen\nIsotopes",

                    "source_content": "Ferdinand Porsche (3 September 1875 – 30 January 1951) was born in Austria.  He was a talented and well-known car designer, especially of race cars.  But he always wanted to make a small car useful for a family.  Finally Adolf Hitler gave him the opportunity to make the Volkswagen Beetle in 1936. But by the time the car started production, war broke out, and the company started making army vehicles instead.  After World War II he was put in a French jail for almost 2 years but never convicted of a crime.  He was released, but his health had been damaged and he died not long afterwards.  He lived long enough to see his beloved small car being successfully produced by the Volkswagen company, but not to see the great success it eventually became.\n\nHe started the Porsche company in 1931.  At first it made designs and prototypes for others (including the Volkswagen Beetle).  Later, under his son Ferry Porsche's leadership, it started making high-end cars.  It continues to produce high power cars to this day.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nBarber, Chris (2003). Birth of the Beetle: The Development of the Volkswagen by Ferdinand Porsche.

                    "source_content": "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book written by Mark Twain, published in 1884. It is a sequel to his earlier book, Tom Sawyer.\n\nStory \nAfter The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Huck was adopted by the widow Douglas who wants to “civilize” him and so he joined Tom’s band of robbers.\n\nOne day, Huck’s father Pap, a violent drunkard, appears in St. Petersburg. When a new judge arrives, Pap gains custody of his son and moves to a cabin on the other side of the river. Huck is kept locked but fakes his own death and hides on Jackson’s Island, a small island on the river. There he meets Miss Watson’s black slave Jim who ran away.\n\nWhen they find a raft, they decide to go to a free state. After a storm, a house is floating down the river and they enter it and grab what they can. Inside, there is a dead man shot in the back and Jim prevents Huck from seeing the dead man’s face.\n\nHuck dresses as a girl and returns to town because he wants to hear what’s going on in town. A woman tells that Jim is considered to be Huck’s murderer. Moreover, she is suspicious about Huck’s true sex and reveals that he is a boy. Huck returns to the island and together with Jim he flees downriver.\n\nAfter some time on the river, they are separated by a passing steaming boat and Huck meets the Grangerfords, a rich family. He befriends with Buck Grangerford who is about his age. The Grangerfords are in a 30-year feud against the Shepherdsons, another rich family along the Mississippi. When a conflict breaks out, all Grangerford males are killed. Huck can escape and reunites with Jim. Together they float further downriver.\n\nLater, they rescue two con men who join the boys on their journey. They pull several scams along the river. Once, they pretend to be a dead man’s brothers and escape after their true identities are revealed.\n\nLater, the elder one sells Jim. Huck finds out that Jim is now owned by the Phelps. He decides to free him and pretends to be the Phelps’ nephew Tom Sawyer. When the real Tom arrives, he plays along.\n\nJim is held in a shed and Tom has a risky escape plan. As they carry out their plan, Tom is shot in the leg. While Huck gets help, Jim remains with Tom. When they return to the farm, Jim is recaptured while Tom is unconscious.\n\nWhen Tom awakes, he reveals that Jim had been free for weeks after his owner died two months ago. He did not tell Huck because he wanted a risky plan to rescue Jim. Furthermore, Tom’s Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck’s and Tom’s real identities. Moreover, Jim tells that Pap was the dead man on the floating house. Finally, Huck decides to go West.\n\nControversy \nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn received often good reviews, but the novel was controversial from the beginning. When the American edition came out in 1885 some libraries banned it.\nToday, many people feel that the book attacks racism and shows that it is bad. Others criticize the book because it shows things like slavery, and uses words like \"nigger\". They also think that, although Jim is not meant to be a bad character, he has some stereotypes of that time.\n\nReferences\n\nRelated pages\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n\nBooks by Mark Twain\n1884 books\nAmerican children's books\n19th-century American novels",

A person with catatonia may look to be in a stupor (being mentally numb and in a daze).  The cause is in the nervous system; the brain and nerves. This problem was first written about in 1874 in Die Katatonie oder das Spannungsirresein.\n\nCauses \nCatatonia can sometimes happen with mental disorders. It can be a symptom of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. Catatonia may also happen when a person abuses drugs or overdoses by taking too much of a drug.\n\nCatatonia can also be caused by many different medical disorders. Some causes are infections, such as encephalitis; autoimmune diseases; damage to the brain from strokes; and metabolic problems. \n\nA person can also get catatonia from benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which happens if the person quickly stops taking benzodiazepine medications.\n\nTreatment \nDoctors can treat catatonia. They usually start with medicines such as benzodiazepines. If those medicines do not work; doctors may use shock therapy. Antipsychotic medicines can also be used, but with safety in mind. Sometimes they can make catatonia worse or have bad side effects. A group of anesthetic drugs called NMDA antagonists may be helpful when benzodiazepines don't work.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites\n Encyclopedia of Mental Disorders - Catatonic Disorders\n\nMental illnesses",

He spent most of his adult life in Russia and Germany.\n\nEuler made important discoveries in calculus and topology. He also created many of the words used in math today. He introduced the notation we use to write mathematical functions. He is also known for his works in mechanics, optics, fluid mechanics, astronomy and music theory.\n\nEuler is considered to be the most important mathematician of the 18th century, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and one of the most prolific writing mathematicians. His collected works fill around 80 volumes. The famous mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace advised, \"Read Euler, read Euler, he is a master for us all.”\n\nEuler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-franc bill and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honor. He is also celebrated by the Lutheran Church on their Calendar of Saints on May 24.\n\nEarly years \n\nEuler was born in Basel to Paul Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church. His mother was Marguerite Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters, Anna-Maria and Maria Magdalena. Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of Riehen, where Euler spent most of his childhood. Euler started school back in Basel, where he lived with his grandmother. At the age of thirteen he went to the University of Basel. In 1723, he received his Master of Philosophy. At this time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's extraordinary talent for mathematics.\n\nRelated pages \n\n Euler-Bernoulli Beam Theory\n Euler–Mascheroni constant\n Euler characteristic\n Euler diagram\n Euler's homogeneous function theorem\n Euler's identity\n Euler's number\n Euler's polyhedron formula\n Euler's totient function\n Euler's totient theorem\n Eulerian path\n\nReferences \n\n1707 births\n1783 deaths\nNumber theorists\nSwiss mathematicians\nMusic theorists\nTheoretical physicists\nScientists from Basel",

The team plays in white, red and green striped shirts, white shorts and white socks.\n\nHistory\nOn January 1, 1941, Fluminense de Feira Futebol Clube was founded. Fluminense de Feira became a professional team in 1954. Two years later, the club was runner-up in Campeonato Baiano. In 1963, the club won Campeonato Baiano, its first professional title. In 1968, the club was again Campeonato Baiano runner-up. In the following year, the club won again the state championship.\n\nIn 1992, Fluminense de Feira was runner-up of Brazilian Third Division, after losing the final to Tuna Luso. But, no promotion was given to Fluminense de Feira or Tuna Luso, because neither the second division, nor the third division were disputed in 1993.\n\nIn 1998, after a very poor campaign, ending in 10th of 12 teams, the club was relegated to the Campeonato Baiano Second Division. In 1999, Fluminense de Feira competed in the Campeonato Baiano Second Division, ending the competition as runner-up, after a 1–1 home match draw, and a 0–0 away match draw against Colo-Colo of Ilhéus. The team gained promotion to the following year's Campeonato Baiano first division.\n\nAchievements\nCampeonato Baiano: 2\n1963, 1969\n\nTaça Estado da Bahia: 2\n1998, 2009\n\nStadium\n\nFluminense de Feira's stadium is Estádio Joia da Princesa, built in 1953, with a maximum capacity of 16,274 people.\n\nSymbols\nThe club is named after Fluminense Football Club of Rio de Janeiro city. Fluminense de Feira's kit, as well as the club logo, are very similar to the Rio de Janeiro's Fluminense ones. The club's nickname, Touro do Sertão, means Backland's Bull.

The name comes from the word \"micro\" and \"encyclopaedia\". Micro means small and so, the Micropaedia is a small encyclopedia. The Micropaedia has articles that are very short, the articles are found in small strips. It is the opposite of the Macropaedia, which has articles that are very long.\n\nThe Micropædia was introduced in 1974 with 10 books having 102,214 short articles, all of them are less than 750 words. In the 15th edition, many articles were put together, with about only 65,000 articles in 12 volumes. In general, the 750-word limit is still used and most articles are only 1-2 paragraphs; however, a few longer articles can be found in the 2007 Micropædia, such as the Internet ones, which takes up a full page.\n\nWith some exceptions, the 65,000 articles of the Micropædia have no bibliographies and no named contributors. It is supposed to be for fast-checking to find out the main things about the topic, and as a guide to the 700 longer articles of the Macropædia.

The English warship  attacked and boarded the American . The British were looking for people who had deserted the Royal Navy. The commander of the American ship surrendered his vessel to the British. When he returned home, he was tired, and had to leave the military.\n\nThe Chesapeake–Leopard Affair made many Americans angry. Some of them wanted to go to war with Great Britain, but most people did not. President Thomas Jefferson tried to use the anger to diplomatically threaten the British government into settling the matter. The United States Congress backed away from armed conflict when British diplomats showed that they felt they did nothing wrong in the matter. The diplomats also said that impressment would continue. Jefferson's political failure to solve the problem with Great Britain led him towards economic warfare: the Embargo of 1807.\n\nFurther reading\nPerkins, Bradford. 1968.
